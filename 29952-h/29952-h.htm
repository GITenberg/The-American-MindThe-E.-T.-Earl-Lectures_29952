Race, Nation, and Book</h2>


<p>Many years ago, as a student in a foreign university,
I remember attacking, with the complacency
of youth, a German history of the
English drama, in six volumes. I lost courage
long before the author reached the age of Elizabeth,
but I still recall the subject of the opening
chapter: it was devoted to the physical geography
of Great Britain. Writing, as the good German
professor did, in the triumphant hour of Taine's
theory as to the significance of place, period,
and environment in determining the character
of any literary production, what could be more
logical than to begin at the beginning? Have
not the chalk cliffs guarding the southern coast
of England, have not the fatness of the midland
counties and the soft rainy climate of a North
Atlantic island, and the proud, tenacious, self-assertive
folk that are bred there, all left their
trace upon <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<i>Every Man in his Humour</i> and <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>?
Undoubtedly. Latitude and longitude,
soil and rainfall and food-supply, racial origins
and crossings, political and social and economic
conditions, must assuredly leave their marks
upon the mental and artistic productiveness of
a people and upon the personality of individual
writers.</p>

<p>Taine, who delighted to point out all this, and
whose <i>English Literature</i> remains a monument
of the defects as well as of the advantages of
his method, was of course not the inventor of
the climatic theory. It is older than Aristotle,
who discusses it in his treatise on <i>Politics</i>. It
was a topic of interest to the scholars of the Renaissance.
Englishmen of the seventeenth century,
with an unction of pseudo-science added to
their natural patriotism, discovered in the English
climate one of the reasons of England's
greatness. Thomas Sprat, writing in 1667 on
the History of the Royal Society, waxes bold and
asserts: "If there can be a true character given
of the Universal Temper of any Nation under
Heaven, then certainly this must be ascribed
to our countrymen, that they have commonly
an unaffected sincerity, that they love to deliver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
their minds with a sound simplicity, that
they have the middle qualities between the reserved,
subtle southern and the rough, unhewn
northern people, that they are not extremely
prone to speak, that they are more concerned
what others will think of the strength than of
the fineness of what they say, and that a universal
modesty possesses them. These qualities
are so conspicuous and proper to the soil that
we often hear them objected to us by some of
our neighbor Satyrists in more disgraceful expressions....
Even the position of our climate,
the air, the influence of the heaven, the
composition of the English blood, as well as the
embraces of the Ocean, seem to join with the
labours of the <i>Royal Society</i> to render our country
a Land of Experimental Knowledge."</p>

<p>The excellent Sprat was the friend and executor
of the poet Cowley, who has in the Preface
to his <i>Poems</i> a charming passage about the relation
of literature to the external circumstances
in which it is written.</p>

<p>"If <i>wit</i> be such a <i>Plant</i> that it scarce receives
heat enough to keep it alive even in the <i>summer</i>
of our cold <i>Clymate</i>, how can it choose but wither
in a long and a sharp <i>winter</i>? a warlike, various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and a tragical age is best to write <i>of</i>, but worst
to write <i>in</i>." And he adds this, concerning his
own art of poetry: "There is nothing that requires
so much serenity and chearfulness of
<i>spirit</i>; it must not be either overwhelmed with
the cares of <i>Life</i>, or overcast with the <i>Clouds</i> of
<i>Melancholy</i> and <i>Sorrow</i>, or shaken and disturbed
with the storms of injurious <i>Fortune</i>; it must,
like the <i>Halcyon</i>, have fair weather to breed in.
The Soul must be filled with bright and delightful
<i>Idaeas</i>, when it undertakes to communicate
delight to others, which is the main end of <i>Poesie</i>.
One may see through the stile of <i>Ovid de
Trist.</i>, the humbled and dejected condition of
<i>Spirit</i> with which he wrote it; there scarce remains
any footstep of that <i>Genius</i>, <i>Quem nec
Jovis ira, nec ignes</i>, etc. The <i>cold</i> of the country
has strucken through all his faculties, and
benummed the very <i>feet</i> of his <i>Verses</i>."</p>

<p>Madame de Staël's <i>Germany</i>, one of the most
famous of the "national character" books, begins
with a description of the German landscape.
But though nobody, from Ovid in exile down
to Madame de Staël, questions the general significance
of place, time, and circumstances as
affecting the nature of a literary product, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
we come to the exact and as it were mathematical
demonstration of the precise workings of
these physical influences, our generation is distinctly
more cautious than were the literary critics
of forty years ago. Indeed, it is a hundred
years since Fisher Ames, ridiculing the theory
that climate acts directly upon literary products,
said wittily of Greece: "The figs are as fine as
ever, but where are the Pindars?" The theory
of race, in particular, has been sharply questioned
by the experts. "Saxon" and "Norman,"
for example, no longer seem to us such simple
terms as sufficed for the purpose of Scott's <i>Ivanhoe</i>
or of Thierry's <i>Norman Conquest</i>, a book
inspired by Scott's romance. The late Professor
Freeman, with characteristic bluntness,
remarked of the latter book: "Thierry says at
the end of his work that there are no longer either
Normans or Saxons except in history....
But in Thierry's sense of the word, it would
be truer to say that there never were 'Normans'
or 'Saxons' anywhere, save in the pages
of romances like his own."</p>

<p>There is a brutal directness about this verdict
upon a rival historian which we shall probably
persist in calling "Saxon"; but it is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
worse than the criticisms of Matthew Arnold's
essay on "The Celtic Spirit" made to-day by
university professors who happen to know
Old Irish at first hand, and consequently consider
Arnold's opinion on Celtic matters to be
hopelessly amateurish.</p>

<p>The wiser scepticism of our day concerning
all hard-and-fast racial distinctions has been admirably
summed up by Josiah Royce. "A race
psychology," he declares, "is still a science for
the future to discover.... We do not scientifically
know what the true racial varieties of
mental type really are. No doubt there are such
varieties. The judgment day, or the science of
the future, may demonstrate what they are. We
are at present very ignorant regarding the whole
matter."</p>

<p>Nowhere have the extravagances of the application
of racial theories to intellectual products
been more pronounced than in the fields
of art and literature. Audiences listen to a waltz
which the programme declares to be an adaptation
of a Hungarian folk-song, and though they
may be more ignorant of Hungary than Shakespeare
was of Bohemia, they have no hesitation
in exclaiming: "How truly Hungarian this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
is!" Or, it may be, how truly "Japanese" is
this vase which was made in Japan&mdash;perhaps
for the American market; or how intensely
"Russian" is this melancholy tale by Turgenieff.
This prompt deduction of racial qualities
from works of art which themselves give the
critic all the information he possesses about the
races in question,&mdash;or, in other words, the enthusiastic
assertion that a thing is like itself,&mdash;is
one of the familiar notes of amateur criticism.
It is travelling in a circle, and the corregiosity
of Corregio is the next station.</p>

<p>Blood tells, no doubt, and a masterpiece usually
betrays some token of the place and hour
of its birth. A knowledge of the condition of
political parties in Athens in 416 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> adds immensely
to the enjoyment of the readers of Aristophanes;
the fun becomes funnier and the daring
even more splendid than before. Molière's
training as an actor does affect the dramaturgic
quality of his comedies. All this is demonstrable,
and to the prevalent consciousness of it our
generation is deeply indebted to Taine and his
pupils. But before displaying dogmatically the
inevitable brandings of racial and national traits
on a national literature, before pointing to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
and that unmistakable evidence of local or temporal
influence on the form or spirit of a masterpiece,
we are now inclined to make some distinct
reservations. These reservations are not without
bearing upon our own literature in America.</p>

<p>There are, for instance, certain artists who
seem to escape the influences of the time-spirit.
The most familiar example is that of Keats. He
can no doubt be assigned to the George the
Fourth period by a critical examination of his
vocabulary, but the characteristic political and
social movements of that epoch in England left
him almost untouched. Edgar Allan Poe might
have written some of his tales in the seventeenth
century or in the twentieth; he might, like
Robert Louis Stevenson, have written in Samoa
rather than in the Baltimore, Philadelphia, or
New York of his day; his description of the
Ragged Mountains of Virginia, within very
sight of the university which he attended, was
borrowed, in the good old convenient fashion,
from Macaulay; in fact, it requires something
of Poe's own ingenuity to find in Poe, who is
one of the indubitable assets of American literature,
anything distinctly American.</p>

<p>Wholly aside from such spiritual insulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of the single writer, there is the obvious fact
that none of the arts, not even literature, and
not all of them together, can furnish a wholly
adequate representation of racial or national
characteristics. It is well known to-day that the
so-called "classic" examples of Greek art, most
of which were brought to light and discoursed
upon by critics from two to four centuries ago,
represent but a single phase of Greek feeling;
and that the Greeks, even in what we choose to
call their most characteristic period, had a distinctly
"romantic" tendency which their more
recently discovered plastic art betrays. But even
if we had all the lost statues, plays, poems, and
orations, all the Greek paintings about which
we know so little, and the Greek music about
which we know still less, does anybody suppose
that this wealth of artistic expression would furnish
a wholly satisfactory notion of the racial
and psychological traits of the Greek people?</p>

<p>One may go even further. Does a truly
national art exist anywhere,&mdash;an art, that is to
say, which conveys a trustworthy and adequate
expression of the national temper as a whole?
We have but to reflect upon the European and
American judgments, during the last thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
years, concerning the representative quality of
the art of Japan, and to observe how many of
those facile generalizations about the Japanese
character, deduced from vases and prints and
enamel, were smashed to pieces by the Russo-Japanese
War. This may illustrate the blunders
of foreign criticism, perhaps, rather than
any inadequacy in the racially representative
character of Japanese art. But it is impossible
that critics, and artists themselves, should not
err, in the conscious endeavor to pronounce
upon the infinitely complex materials with which
they are called upon to deal. We must confess
that the expression of racial and national characteristics,
by means of only one art, such as literature,
or by all the arts together, is at best imperfect,
and is always likely to be misleading
unless corroborated by other evidence.</p>

<p>For it is to be remembered that in literature,
as in the other fields of artistic activity, we are
dealing with the question of form; of securing
a concrete and pleasurable embodiment of certain
emotions. It may well happen that literature
not merely fails to give an adequate report
of the racial or national or personal emotions
felt during a given epoch, but that it fails to report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
these emotions at all. Not only the "old,
unhappy, far-off" things of racial experience,
but the new and delight-giving experiences of
the hour, may lack their poet. Widespread
moods of public elation or wistfulness or depression
have passed without leaving a shadow
upon the mirror of art. There was no one to
hold the mirror or even to fashion it. No note
of Renaissance criticism, whether in Italy,
France, or England, is more striking, and in a
way more touching, than the universal feeling
that in the rediscovery of the classics men had
found at last the "terms of art," the rules and
methods of a game which they had long wished
to be playing. Englishmen and Frenchmen of
the sixteenth century will not allow that their
powers are less virile, their emotions less eager,
than those of the Greeks and Romans. Only,
lacking the very terms of art, they had not been
able to arrive at fit expression; the soul had
found no body wherewith to clothe itself into
beauty. As they avowed in all simplicity, they
needed schoolmasters; the discipline of Aristotle
and Horace and Virgil; a body of critical
doctrine, to teach them how to express the
France and England or Italy of their day, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
thus give permanence to their fleeting vision of
the world. Naïve as may have been the Renaissance
expression of this need of formal training,
blind as it frequently was to the beauty which
we recognize in the undisciplined vernacular literatures
of mediæval Europe, those groping
scholars were essentially right. No one can
paint or compose by nature. One must slowly
master an art of expression.</p>

<p>Now through long periods of time, and over
many vast stretches of territory, as our own
American writing abundantly witnesses, the
whole formal side of expression may be neglected.
"Literature," in its narrower sense,
may not exist. In that restricted and higher
meaning of the term, literature has always been
uncommon enough, even in Athens or Florence.
It demands not merely personal distinction
or power, not merely some uncommon
height or depth or breadth of capacity and insight,
but a purely artistic training, which in the
very nature of the case is rare. Millions of Russians,
perhaps, have felt about the general problems
of life much as Turgenieff felt, but they
lacked the sheer literary art with which the
<i>Notes of a Sportsman</i> was written. Thousands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
frontier lawyers and politicians shared Lincoln's
hard and varied and admirable training in the
mastery of speech, but in his hands alone was
the weapon wrought to such perfection of temper
and weight and edge that he spoke and
wrote literature without knowing it.</p>

<p>Such considerations belong, I am aware, to
the accepted commonplaces,&mdash;perhaps to what
William James used to call "the unprofitable
delineation of the obvious." Everybody recognizes
that literary gifts imply an exceptionally
rich development of general human capacities,
together with a professional aptitude and training
of which but few men are capable. There is
but one lumberman in camp who can play the
fiddle, though the whole camp can dance. Thus
the great book, we are forever saying, is truly
representative of myriads of minds in a certain
degree of culture, although but one man could
have written it. The writing member of a family
is often the one who acquires notoriety and
a bank account, but he is likely to have candid
friends who admit, though not always in his
presence, that, aside from this one professional
gift and practice, he is not intellectually or emotionally
or spiritually superior to his brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
and sisters. Waldo Emerson thought himself
the intellectual inferior of his brother
Charles; and good observers loved to maintain
that John Holmes was wittier than Oliver
Wendell, and Ezekiel Webster a better lawyer
than Daniel.</p>

<p>Applied to the literary history of a race, this
principle is suggestive. We must be slow to affirm
that, because certain ideas and feelings did
not attain, in this or that age or place, to purely
literary expression, they were therefore not in
existence. The men and women of the colonial
period in our own country, for instance, have
been pretty uniformly declared to have been
deficient in the sense of beauty. What is the evidence?
It is mostly negative. They produced
no poetry, fiction, painting, sculpture, or music
worthy of the name. They were predominantly
Puritan, and the whole world has been informed
that English Puritanism was hostile to Art.
They were preoccupied with material and moral
concerns. Even if they had remained in England,
Professor Trent affirms, these contemporaries
of Milton and Bunyan would have produced
no art or literature. Now it is quite true
that for nearly two hundred years after the date<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of the first settlement of the American colonists,
opportunities for cultivating the arts did not
exist. But that the sense of beauty was wholly
atrophied, I, for one, do not believe. The passionate
eagerness with which the forefathers absorbed
the noblest of all poetry and prose in the
pages of their one book, the Bible; the unwearied
curiosity and care with which those farmers and
fishermen and woodsmen read the signs of the
sky; their awe of the dark wilderness and their
familiar traffic with the great deep; the silences
of lonely places; the opulence of primeval
meadows by the clear streams; the English
flowers that were made to bloom again in farmhouse
windows and along garden walks; the
inner visions, more lovely still, of duty and of
moral law; the spirit of sacrifice; the daily walk
with God, whether by green pastures of the
spirit or through ways that were dark and terrible;&mdash;is
there in all this no discipline of the
soul in moral beauty, and no training of the eye
to perceive the exquisite harmonies of the visible
earth? It is true that the Puritans had no
professional men of letters; it is true that doctrinal
sermons provided their chief intellectual
sustenance; true that their lives were stern, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
that many of the softer emotions were repressed.
But beauty may still be traced in the fragments
of their recorded speech, in their diaries and
letters and phrases of devotion. You will search
the eighteenth century of old England in vain
for such ecstasies of wonder at the glorious
beauty of the universe as were penned by Jonathan
Edwards in his youthful <i>Diary</i>. There is
every presumption, from what we know of the
two men, that Whittier's father and grandfather
were peculiarly sensitive to the emotions of
home and neighborhood and domesticity which
their gifted descendant&mdash;too physically frail
to be absorbed in the rude labor of the farm&mdash;has
embodied in <i>Snow-Bound</i>. The Quaker
poet knew that he surpassed his forefathers in
facility in verse-making, but he would have been
amused (as his <i>Margaret Smith's Journal</i> proves)
at the notion that his ancestors were without a
sense of beauty or that they lacked responsiveness
to the chords of fireside sentiment. He
was simply the only Whittier, except his sister
Elizabeth, who had ever found leisure, as old-fashioned
correspondents used to say, "to take
his pen in hand." This leisure developed in him
the sense&mdash;latent no doubt in his ancestors&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the beauty of words, and the excitement
of rhythm. Emerson's <i>Journal</i> in the eighteen-thirties
glows with a Dionysiac rapture over
what he calls "delicious days"; but did the
seven generations of clergymen from whom
Emerson descended have no delicious and
haughty and tender days that passed unrecorded?
Formal literature perpetuates and
glorifies many aspects of individual and national
experience; but how much eludes it wholly, or
is told, if at all, in broken syllables, in Pentecostal
tongues that seem to be our own and yet
are unutterably strange!</p>

<p>To confess thus that literature, in the proper
sense of the word, represents but a narrow segment
of personal or racial experience, is very
far from a denial of the genuineness and the
significance of the affirmations which literature
makes. We recognize instinctively that Whittier's
<i>Snow-Bound</i> is a truthful report, not merely
of a certain farmhouse kitchen in East Haverhill,
Massachusetts, during the early nineteenth
century, but of a mode of thinking and feeling
which is widely diffused wherever the Anglo-Saxon
race has wandered. Perhaps <i>Snow-Bound</i>
lacks a certain universality of suggestiveness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
which belongs to a still more famous poem, <i>The
Cotter's Saturday Night</i> of Burns, but both of
these portrayals of rustic simplicity and peace
owe their celebrity to their truly representative
character. They are evidence furnished by a
single art, as to a certain mode and coloring of
human existence; but every corroboration of
that evidence heightens our admiration for the
artistic sincerity and insight of the poet. To
draw an illustration from a more splendid epoch,
let us remind ourselves that the literature of
the "spacious times of great Elizabeth"&mdash;a
period of strong national excitement, and one
deeply representative of the very noblest and
most permanent traits of English national character&mdash;was
produced within startlingly few
years and in a local territory extremely limited.
The very language in which that literature is
clothed was spoken only by the court, by a couple
of counties, and at the two universities. Its
prose and verse were frankly experimental. It
is true that such was the emotional ferment of
the score of years preceding the Armada, that
great captains and voyagers who scarcely wrote
a line were hailed as kings of the realm of imagination,
and that Puttenham, in phrases which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
that generation could not have found extravagant,
inscribes his book on Poetry to Queen
Elizabeth as the "most excellent Poet" of the
age. Well, the glorified political images may
grow dim or tawdry with time, but the poetry
has endured, and it is everywhere felt to be a
truly national, a deeply racial product. Its time
and place and hour were all local; but the Canadian
and the American, the South African
and Australasian Englishman feels that that
Elizabethan poetry is his poetry still.</p>

<p>When we pass, therefore, as we must shortly
do, to the consideration of this and that literary
product of America, and to the scrutiny of the
really representative character of our books, we
must bear in mind that the questions concerning
the race, the place, the hour, the man,&mdash;questions
so familiar to modern criticism,&mdash;remain
valid and indeed essential; but that in applying
them to American writing there are certain
allowances, qualifications, adjustments of
the scale of values, which are no less important
to an intelligent perception of the quality of our
literature. This task is less simple than the critical
assessment of a typical German or French
or Scandinavian writer, where the strain of blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
is unmixed, the continuity of literary tradition
unbroken, the precise impact of historical and
personal influences more easy to estimate. I
open, for example, any one of half a dozen
French studies of Balzac. Here is a many-sided
man, a multifarious writer, a personality that
makes ridiculous the merely formal pigeon-holing
and labelling processes of professional
criticism. And yet with what perfect precision
of method and certainty of touch do Le Breton,
for example, or Brunetière, in their books on
Balzac, proceed to indicate those impulses of
race and period and environment which affected
the character of Balzac's novels! The fact that
he was born in Tours in 1799 results in the inevitable
and inevitably expert paragraphs about
Gallic blood, and the physical exuberance of the
Touraine surroundings of his youth, and the
post-revolutionary tendency to disillusion and
analysis. And so with Balzac's education, his
removal to Paris in the Restoration period, his
ventures in business and his affairs of love, his
admiration for Shakespeare and for Fenimore
Cooper; his mingled Romanticism and Realism;
his Titanism and his childishness; his stupendous
outline for the Human Comedy; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
his scarcely less astounding actual achievement.
All this is discussed by his biographers with the
professional dexterity of critics trained intellectually
in the Latin traditions and instinctively
aware of the claims of race, biographers familiar
with every page of French history, and profoundly
interested, like their readers, in every
aspect of French life. Alas, we may say, in
despairing admiration of such workmanship,
"they order these things better in France."
And they do; but racial unity, and long lines of
national literary tradition, make these things
easier to order than they are with us. The
intellectual distinction of American critical
biographies like Lounsbury's <i>Cooper</i> or Woodberry's
<i>Hawthorne</i> is all the more notable because
we possess such a slender body of truly
critical doctrine native to our own soil; because
our national literary tradition as to available
material and methods is hardly formed; because
the very word "American" has a less precise
connotation than the word "New Zealander."</p>

<p>Let us suppose, for instance, that like Professor
Woodberry a few years ago, we were
asked to furnish a critical study of Hawthorne.
The author of <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> is one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
most justly famous of American writers. But
precisely what national traits are to be discovered
in this eminent fellow-countryman of ours?
We turn, like loyal disciples of Taine and Sainte-Beuve,
to his ancestral stock. We find that it
is English as far back as it can be traced; as
purely English as the ancestry of Dickens or
Thackeray, and more purely English than the
ancestry of Browning or Burke or His Majesty
George the Fifth. Was Hawthorne, then, simply
an Englishman living in America? He
himself did not think so,&mdash;as his <i>English Note-Books</i>
abundantly prove. But just what subtle
racial differentiation had been at work, since
William Hawthorne migrated to Massachusetts
with Winthrop in 1630? Here we face, unless
I am mistaken, that troublesome but fascinating
question of Physical Geography. Climate,
soil, food, occupation, religious or moral preoccupation,
social environment, Salem witchcraft
and Salem seafaring had all laid their invisible
hands upon the physical and intellectual
endowment of the child born in 1804. Does
this make Nathaniel Hawthorne merely an
"Englishman with a difference," as Mr. Kipling,
born in India, is an "Englishman with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
difference"? Hawthorne would have smiled,
or, more probably, he would have sworn, at such
a question. He considered himself an American
Democrat; in fact a <i>contra mundum</i> Democrat,
for good or for ill. Is it, then, a political
theory, first put into full operation in this
country a scant generation before Hawthorne's
birth, which made him un-English? We must
walk warily here. Our Canadian neighbors of
English stock have much the same climate, soil,
occupations, and preoccupations as the inhabitants
of the northern territory of the United
States. They have much the same courts,
churches, and legislatures. They read the same
books and magazines. They even prefer baseball
to cricket. They are loyal adherents of a
monarchy, but they are precisely as free, as self-governing,
and&mdash;in the social sense of the
word&mdash;as "democratic"&mdash;in spite of the absence
of a republican form of government&mdash;as
the citizens of that "land of the free and home
of the brave" which lies to the south of them.
Yet Canadian literature, one may venture to
affirm, has remained to this hour a "colonial"
literature, or, if one prefers the phrase, a literature
of "Greater Britain." Was Hawthorne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
possibly right in his instinct that politics did
make a difference, and that in writing <i>The
Marble Faun</i>,&mdash;the scene of which is laid in
Rome,&mdash;or <i>The House of the Seven Gables</i>,&mdash;which
is a story of Salem,&mdash;he was consistently
engaged in producing, not "colonial"
or "Greater-British" but distinctly American
literature? We need not answer this question
prematurely, if we wish to reserve our judgment,
but it is assuredly one of the questions
which the biographers and critics of our men
of letters must ultimately face and answer.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the student of literature produced
in the United States of America must
face other questions almost as complicated as
this of race. In fact, when we choose Hawthorne
as a typical case in which to observe the American
refashioning of the English temper into
something not English, we are selecting a very
simple problem compared with the complexities
which have resulted from the mingling of
various European stocks upon American soil.
But take, for the moment, the mere obvious
matter of expanse of territory. We are obliged
to reckon, not with a compact province such as
those in which many Old World literatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
have been produced, but with what our grandfathers
considered a "boundless continent."
This vast national domain was long ago "organized"
for political purposes: but so far as
literature is concerned it remains unorganized
to-day. We have, as has been constantly observed,
no literary capital, like London or Paris,
to serve as the seat of centralized authority;
no code of literary procedure and conduct; no
"lawgivers of Parnassus"; no supreme court of
letters, whose judgments are recognized and
obeyed. American public opinion asserts itself
with singular unanimity and promptness in the
field of politics. In literary matters we remain
in the stage of anarchic individualism, liable to
be stampeded from time to time by mob-excitement
over a popular novel or moralistic
tract, and then disintegrating, as before, into
an incoherent mass of individually intelligent
readers.</p>

<p>The reader who has some personal acquaintance
with the variations of type in different sections
of this immense territory of ours finds his
curiosity constantly stimulated by the presence
of sectional and local characteristics. There are
sharply cut provincial peculiarities, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
in Great Britain and in Germany, in Italy and
Spain, and in all of the countries a corresponding
"regional" literature has been developed.
Our provincial variations of accent and vocabulary,
in passing from North to South or East
to West, are less striking, on the whole, than
the dialectical differences found in the various
English counties. But our general uniformity
of grammar and the comparatively slight variations
in spoken accent cover an extraordinary
variety of local and sectional modes of thinking
and feeling. The reader of American short
stories and lyrics must constantly ask himself:
Is this truth to local type consistent with the
main trend of American production? Is this
merely a bit of Virginia or Texas or California,
or does it, while remaining no less Southern or
Western in its local coloring, suggest also the
ampler light, the wide generous air of the United
States of America?</p>

<p>The observer of this relationship between
local and national types will find some American
communities where all the speech or habitual
thought is of the future. Foreigners usually
consider such communities the most typically
"American," as doubtless they are; but there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
are other sections, still more faithfully exploited
by local writers, where the mood is wistful and
habitually regards the past. America, too, like
the Old World,&mdash;and in New England more
than elsewhere,&mdash;has her note of decadence,
of disillusion, of autumnal brightness and transiency.
Some sections of the country, and notably
the slave-holding states in the forty years
preceding the Civil War, have suffered widespread
intellectual blight. The best talent of
the South, for a generation, went into politics,
in the passionately loyal endeavor to prop up
a doomed economic and social system; and the
loss to the intellectual life of the country cannot
be reckoned. Over vast sections of our
prosperous and intelligent people of the Mississippi
Basin to-day the very genius of commonplaceness
seems to hover. Take the great
State of Iowa, with its well-to-do and homogeneous
population, its fortunate absence of
perplexing city-problems, its general air of prosperity
and content. It is a typical state of the
most typically American portion of the country;
but it breeds no books. Yet in Indiana, another
state of the same general conditions as to population
and prosperity, and only one generation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
further removed than Iowa from primitive pioneer
conditions, books are produced at a rate
which provokes a universal American smile.
I do not affirm that the literary critic is bound
to answer all such local puzzles as this. But he
is bound at least to reflect upon them, and to
demand of every local literary product throughout
this varied expanse of states: Is the root of
the "All-American" plant growing here, or is
it not?</p>

<p>Furthermore, the critic must pursue this investigation
of national traits in our writing, not
only over a wide and variegated territory, but
through a very considerable sweep of time.
American literature is often described as "callow,"
as the revelation of "national inexperience,"
and in other similar terms. It is true that
we had no professional men of letters before
Irving and that the blossoming time of the notable
New England group of writers did not
come until nearly the middle of the nineteenth
century. But we have had time enough, after
all, to show what we wish to be and what we are.
There have been European books about
America ever since the days of Columbus; it is
three hundred years since the first books were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
written in America. Modern English prose,
the language of journalism, of science, of social
intercourse, came into being only in the early
eighteenth century, in the age of Queen Anne.
But Cotton Mather's <i>Magnalia</i>, a vast book
dealing with the past history of New England,
was printed in 1702, only a year later than Defoe's
<i>True-Born Englishman</i>. For more than two
centuries the development of English speech
and English writing on this side of the Atlantic
has kept measurable pace&mdash;now slower, now
swifter&mdash;with the speech of the mother country.
When we recall the scanty term of years within
which was produced the literature of the age of
Elizabeth, it seems like special pleading to insist
that America has not yet had time to learn
or recite her bookish lessons.</p>

<p>This is not saying that we have had a continuous
or adequate development, either of
the intellectual life, or of literary expression.
There are certain periods of strong intellectual
movement, of heightened emotion, alike in the
colonial epoch and since the adoption of our
present form of government, in which it is natural
to search for revelations of those qualities
which we now feel to be essential to our national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
character. Certain epochs of our history, in
other words, have been peculiarly "American,"
and have furnished the most ideal expression
of national tendencies.</p>

<p>If asked to select the three periods of our
history which in this sense have been most significant,
most of us, I imagine, would choose
the first vigorous epoch of New England Puritanism,
say from 1630 to 1676; then, the epoch
of the great Virginians, say from 1766 to 1789;
and finally the epoch of distinctly national feeling,
in which New England and the West were
leaders, between 1830 and 1865. Those three
generations have been the most notable in the
three hundred years since the permanent settlements
began. Each of them has revealed, in a
noble fashion, the political, ethical, and emotional
traits of our people; and although the
first two of the three periods concerned themselves
but little with literary expression of the
deep-lying characteristics of our stock, the
expression is not lacking. Thomas Hooker's
sermon on the "Foundation of Political Authority,"
John Winthrop's grave advice on the
"Nature of Liberty," Jefferson's "Declaration,"
Webster's "Reply to Hayne," Lincoln's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
"Inaugurals," are all fundamentally American.
They are political in their immediate purpose,
but, like the speeches of Edmund Burke, they
are no less literature because they are concerned
with the common needs and the common destiny.
Hooker and Winthrop wrote before our
formal national existence began; Jefferson, at
the hour of the nation's birth; and Lincoln, in
the day of its sharpest trial. Yet, though separated
from one another by long intervals of
time, the representative figures of the three
epochs, English in blood and American in feeling,
are not so unlike as one might think. A
thorough grasp of our literature thus requires&mdash;and
in scarcely less a degree than the mastery
of one of the literatures of Europe&mdash;a survey
of a long period, the search below the baffling
or contradictory surface of national experience
for the main drift of that experience, and the
selection of the writers, of one generation after
another, who have given the most fit and permanent
and personalized expression to the underlying
forces of the national life.</p>

<p>There is another preliminary word which
needs no less to be said. It concerns the question
of international influences upon national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
literature. Our own generation has been taught
by many events that no race or country can
any longer live "to itself." Internationalism
is in the very atmosphere: and not merely as
regards politics in the narrowed sense, but with
reference to questions of economics, sociology,
art, and letters. The period of international isolation
of the United States, we are rather too
fond of saying, closed with the Spanish-American
War. It would be nearer the truth to say
that so far as the things of the mind and the
spirit are concerned, there has never been any
absolute isolation. The Middle West, from
the days of Jackson to Lincoln, that raw West
described by Dickens and Mrs. Trollope, comes
nearer isolation than any other place or time.
The period of the most eloquent assertions of
American independence in artistic and literary
matters was the epoch of New England Transcendentalism,
which was itself singularly cosmopolitan
in its literary appetites. The letters
and journals of Emerson, Whitman, and Thoreau
show the strong European meat on which
these men fed, just before their robust declarations
of our self-sufficiency. But there is no
real self-sufficiency, and Emerson and Whitman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
themselves, in other moods, have written
most suggestive passages upon our European
inheritances and affiliations.</p>

<p>The fortunes of the early New England colonies,
in fact, were followed by Protestant Europe
with the keen solicitude and affection of
kinsmen. Oliver Cromwell signs his letter
to John Cotton in 1651, "Your affectionate
friend to serve you." The settlements were regarded
as outposts of European ideas. Their
Calvinism, so cheaply derided and so superficially
understood, even to-day, was the intellectual
platform of that portion of Europe
which was mentally and morally awake to the
vast issues involved in individual responsibility
and self-government. Contemporary
European democracy is hardly yet aware that
Calvin's <i>Institutes</i> is one of its great charters.
Continental Protestantism of the seventeenth
century, like the militant Republicanism of
the English Commonwealth, thus perused with
fraternal interest the letters from Massachusetts
Bay. And if Europe watched America
in those days, it was no less true that America
was watching Europe. Towards the end of
the century, Cotton Mather, "prostrate in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
dust" before the Lord, as his newly published
<i>Diary</i> tells us, is wrestling "on the behalf of
whole nations." He receives a "strong Persuasion
that very overturning Dispensations of
Heaven will quickly befal the French Empire";
he "lifts up his Cries for a mighty and
speedy Revolution" there. "I spread before the
Lord the Condition of His Church abroad ... especially
in Great Britain and in France. And I
prayed that the poor Vaudois may not be ruined
by the Peace now made between France and
Savoy. I prayed likewise for further Mortifications
upon the Turkish Empire." Here
surely was one colonial who was trying, in Cecil
Rhodes's words, to "think continentally!"</p>

<p>Furthermore, the leaders of those early colonies
were in large measure university men,
disciplined in the classics, fit representatives of
European culture. It has been reckoned that
between the years 1630 and 1690 there were
in New England as many graduates of Cambridge
and Oxford as could be found in any
population of similar size in the mother country.
At one time during those years there was
in Massachusetts and Connecticut alone a
Cambridge graduate for every two hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
fifty inhabitants. Like the exiled Greeks in
Matthew Arnold's poem, they "undid their
corded bales"&mdash;of learning, it is true, rather
than of merchandise&mdash;upon these strange and
inhospitable shores: and the traditions of
Greek and Hebrew and Latin scholarship were
maintained with no loss of continuity. To the
lover of letters there will always be something
fine in the thought of that narrow seaboard
fringe of faith in the classics, widening slowly
as the wilderness gave way, making its invisible
road up the rivers, across the mountains,
into the great interior basin, and only after the
Civil War finding an enduring home in the
magnificent state universities of the West.
Lovers of Greek and Roman literature may
perhaps always feel themselves pilgrims and
exiles in this vast industrial democracy of ours,
but they have at least secured for us, and that
from the very first day of the colonies, some
of the best fruitage of internationalism. For
that matter, what was, and is, that one Book&mdash;to
the eyes of the Protestant seventeenth
century infallible and inexpressively sacred&mdash;but
the most potent and universal commerce
of ideas and spirit, passing from the Orient,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
through Greek and Roman civilization, into
the mind and heart of Western Europe and
America?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, East is East, and West is West,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never the twain shall meet,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>declares a confident poet of to-day. But East
and West met long ago in the matchless phrases
translated from Hebrew and Greek and Latin
into the English Bible; and the heart of the
East there answers to the heart of the West as
in water face answereth to face. That the colonizing
Englishmen of the seventeenth century
were Hebrews in spiritual culture, and heirs of
Greece and Rome without ceasing to be Anglo-Saxon
in blood, is one of the marvels of the history
of civilization, and it is one of the basal
facts in the intellectual life of the United States
of to-day.</p>

<p>Yet that life, as I have already hinted, is not
so simple in its terms as it might be if we had to
reckon merely with the men of a single stock,
albeit with imaginations quickened by contact
with an Oriental religion, and minds disciplined,
directly or indirectly, by the methods and the
literatures which the Revival of Learning imposed
upon modern Europe. American formal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
culture is, and has been, from the beginning, predominantly
English. Yet it has been colored by
the influences of other strains of race, and by
alien intellectual traditions. Such international
influences as have reached us through German
and Scandinavian, Celtic and Italian, Russian
and Jewish immigration, are well marked in
certain localities, although their traces may be
difficult to follow in the main trend of American
writing. The presence of Negro, Irishman, Jew,
and German, has affected our popular humor
and satire, and is everywhere to be marked in
the vocabulary and tone of our newspapers.
The cosmopolitan character of the population
of such cities as New York and Chicago strikes
every foreign observer. Each one of the manifold
races now transplanted here and in process
of Americanization has for a while its own newspapers
and churches and social life carried on in
a foreign dialect. But this stage of evolution
passes swiftly. The assimilative forces of American
schools, industry, commerce, politics, are
too strong for the foreign immigrant to resist.
The Italian or Greek fruit pedler soon prefers
to talk English, and his children can be made
to talk nothing else. This extraordinary amalgamating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
power of English culture explains,
no doubt, why German and Scandinavian immigration&mdash;to
take examples from two of the
most intelligent and educated races that have
contributed to the up-building of the country&mdash;have
left so little trace, as yet, upon our
more permanent literature.</p>

<p>But blood will have its say sooner or later.
No one knows how profoundly the strong
mentality of the Jew, already evident enough
in the fields of manufacturing and finance, will
mould the intellectual life of the United States.
The mere presence, to say nothing of the rapid
absorption, of these millions upon millions of
aliens, as the children of the Puritans regard
them, is a constant evidence of the subtle ways
in which internationalism is playing its part in
the fashioning of the American temper. The
moulding hand of the German university has
been laid upon our higher institutions of learning
for seventy years, although no one can
demonstrate in set terms whether the influence
of Goethe, read now by three generations of
American scholars and studied by millions of
youth in the schools, has left any real mark upon
our literature. Abraham Lincoln, in his store-keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
days, used to sit under a tree outside
the grocery store of Lincoln and Berry, reading
Voltaire. One would like to think that he
then and there assimilated something of the incomparable
lucidity of style of the great Frenchman.
But Voltaire's influence upon Lincoln's
style cannot be proved, any more than Rousseau's
direct influence upon Jefferson. Tolstoï
and Ibsen have, indeed, left unmistakable traces
upon American imaginative writing during the
last quarter of a century. Frank Norris was indebted
to Zola for the scheme of that uncompleted
trilogy, the prose epic of the Wheat; and
Owen Wister has revealed a not uncommon experience
of our younger writing men in confessing
that the impulse toward writing his Western
stories came to him after reading the delightful
pages of a French romancer. But all this tells
us merely what we knew well enough before:
that from colonial days to the present hour the
Atlantic has been no insuperable barrier between
the thought of Europe and the mind of
America; that no one race bears aloft all the
torches of intellectual progress; and that a really
vital writer of any country finds a home in the
spiritual life of every other country, even though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
it may be difficult to find his name in the local
directory.</p>

<p>Finally, we must bear in mind that purely
literary evidence as to the existence of certain
national traits needs corroboration from many
non-literary sources. If it is dangerous to judge
modern Japan by the characteristics of a piece
of pottery, it is only less misleading to select
half a dozen excellent New England writers of
fifty years ago as sole witnesses to the qualities
of contemporary America. We must broaden
the range of evidence. The historians of American
literature must ultimately reckon with all
those sources of mental and emotional quickening
which have yielded to our pioneer people
a substitute for purely literary pleasures:
they must do justice to the immense mass of
letters, diaries, sermons, editorials, speeches,
which have served as the grammar and phrase-book
of national feeling. A history of our literature
must be flexible enough, as I have said
elsewhere, to include "the social and economic
and geographical background of American life;
the zest of the explorer, the humor of the pioneer;
the passion of old political battles; the
yearning after spiritual truth and social readjustment;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the baffled quest of beauty. Such a
history must be broad enough for the <i>Federalist</i>
and for Webster's oratory, for Beecher's sermons
and Greeley's editorials, and the Lincoln-Douglas
debates. It must picture the daily
existence of our citizens from the beginning;
their working ideas, their phrases and shibboleths
and all their idols of the forum and the
cave. It should portray the misspelled ideals
of a profoundly idealistic people who have been
usually immersed in material things."</p>

<p>Our most characteristic American writing,
as must be pointed out again and again, is not
the self-conscious literary performance of a Poe
or a Hawthorne. It is civic writing; a citizen
literature, produced, like the <i>Federalist</i>, and
Garrison's editorials and Grant's <i>Memoirs</i>, without
any stylistic consciousness whatever; a sort
of writing which has been incidental to the accomplishment
of some political, social, or moral
purpose, and which scarcely regards itself as
literature at all. The supreme example of it is
the "Gettysburg Address." Homeliness, simplicity,
directness, preoccupation with moral
issues, have here been but the instrument of
beauty; phrase and thought and feeling have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
noble fitness to the national theme. "Nothing
of Europe here," we may instinctively exclaim,
and yet the profounder lesson of this citizen
literature of ours is in the universality of the
fundamental questions which our literature presents.
The "Gettysburg Address" would not
to-day have a secure fame in Europe if it spoke
nothing to the ear and the heart of Europe.
And this brings us back to our main theme.
Lincoln, like Franklin, like many another
lesser master of our citizen literature, is a typical
American. In the writing produced by such
men, there cannot but be a revelation of American
characteristics. We are now to attempt an
analysis of these national traits, as they have
been expressed by our representative writers.</p>

<p>Simple as the problem seems, when thus
stated, its adequate performance calls for a
constant sensitiveness to the conditions prevalent,
during a long period, in English and Continental
society and literature. The most rudimentary
biographical sketch of such eminent
contemporary American authors as Mr. Henry
James and Mr. Howells shows that Europe
is an essential factor in the intellectual life and
in the artistic procedure of these writers. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
in their racial and national relationships they
are indubitably American. In their local variations
from type they demand from the critic
an understanding of the culture of the Ohio
Valley, and of Boston and New York. The
analysis of the mingled racial, psychological,
social, and professional traits in these masters of
contemporary American fiction presents to the
critic a problem as fascinating as, and I think
more complex than, a corresponding study of
Meredith or Hardy, of Daudet or D'Annunzio.
In the three hundred years that have
elapsed since Englishmen who were trained
under Queen Elizabeth settled at Jamestown,
Virginia, we have bred upon this soil many a
master of speech. They have been men of
varied gifts: now of clear intelligence, now of
commanding power; men of rugged simplicity
and of tantalizing subtlety; poets, novelists,
orators, essayists, and publicists, who have interpreted
the soul of America to the mind of
the world. Our task is to exhibit the essential
Americanism of these spokesmen of ours, to
point out the traits which make them most
truly representative of the instincts of the
tongue-tied millions who work and plan and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
pass from sight without the gift and art of
utterance; to find, in short, among the books
which are recognized as constituting our American
literature, some vital and illuminating illustrations
of our national characteristics. For
a truly "American" book&mdash;like an American
national game, or an American city&mdash;is that
which reveals, consciously or unconsciously,
the American mind.</p>

The American Mind</h2>


<p>The origin of the phrase, "the American
mind," was political. Shortly after the middle
of the eighteenth century, there began to be a
distinctly American way of regarding the debatable
question of British Imperial control.
During the period of the Stamp Act agitation
our colonial-bred politicians and statesmen
made the discovery that there was a mode of
thinking and feeling which was native&mdash;or
had by that time become a second nature&mdash;to
all the colonists. Jefferson, for example,
employs those resonant and useful words "the
American mind" to indicate that throughout
the American colonies an essential unity of
opinion had been developed as regards the
chief political question of the day.</p>

<p>It is one of the most striking characteristics
of the present United States that this instinct of
political unity should have endured, triumphing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
over every temporary motive of division. The
inhabitants of the United States belong to a
single political type. There is scarcely a news-stand
in any country of Continental Europe
where one may not purchase a newspaper
openly or secretly opposed to the government,&mdash;not
merely attacking an unpopular administration
or minister or ruler,&mdash;but desiring
and plotting the overthrow of the entire political
system of the country. It is very difficult
to find such a newspaper anywhere in the
United States. I myself have never seen one.
The opening sentence of President Butler's
admirable little book, <i>The American as He
Is</i>, originally delivered as lectures before the
University of Copenhagen, runs as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The most impressive fact in American life
is the substantial unity of view in regard to
the fundamental questions of government and
of conduct among a population so large, distributed
over an area so wide, recruited from
sources so many and so diverse, living under
conditions so widely different."</p></blockquote>

<p>But the American type of mind is evident
in many other fields than that of politics.
The stimulating book from which I have just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
quoted, attempts in its closing paragraph, after
touching upon the more salient features of our
national activity, to define the typical American
in these words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The typical American is he who, whether
rich or poor, whether dwelling in the North,
South, East, or West, whether scholar, professional
man, merchant, manufacturer, farmer,
or skilled worker for wages, lives the life of a
good citizen and good neighbor; who believes
loyally and with all his heart in his country's
institutions, and in the underlying principles
on which these institutions are built; who
directs both his private and his public life by
sound principles; who cherishes high ideals;
and who aims to train his children for a useful
life and for their country's service."</p></blockquote>

<p>This modest and sensible statement indicates
the existence of a national point of view. We
have developed in the course of time, as a result
of certain racial inheritances and historic experiences,
a national "temper" or "ethos"; a
more or less settled way of considering intellectual,
moral, and social problems; in short, a
peculiarly national attitude toward the universal
human questions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>In a narrower sense, "the American mind"
may mean the characteristics of the American intelligence,
as it has been studied by Mr. Bryce,
De Tocqueville, and other trained observers
of our methods of thinking. It may mean the
specific achievements of the American intelligence
in fields like science and scholarship and
history. In all these particular departments of
intellectual activity the methods and the results
of American workers have recently received expert
and by no means uniformly favorable assessment
from investigators upon both sides of
the Atlantic. But the observer of literary processes
and productions must necessarily take a
somewhat broader survey of national tendencies.
He must study what Nathaniel Hawthorne,
with the instinct of a romance writer,
preferred to call the "heart" as distinguished
from the mere intellect. He must watch the
moral and social and imaginative impulses of
the individual; the desire for beauty; the hunger
for self-expression; the conscious as well as the
unconscious revelation of personality; and he
must bring all this into relation&mdash;if he can,
and knowing that the finer secrets are sure to
elude him!&mdash;with the age-long impulses of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
race and with the mysterious tides of feeling
that flood or ebb with the changing fortunes of
the nation.</p>

<p>One way to begin to understand the typical
American is to take a look at him in Europe.
It does not require a professional beggar or
a licensed guide to identify him. Not that the
American in Europe need recall in any particular
the familiar pictorial caricature of "Uncle
Sam." He need not bear any outward resemblances
to such stage types as that presented in
"The Man From Home." He need not even
suggest, by peculiarities of speech or manner,
that he has escaped from the pages of those
novels of international observation in which
Mr. James and Mr. Howells long ago attained
an unmatched artistry. Our "American
Abroad," at the present hour, may be studied
without the aid of any literary recollections
whatever. There he is, with his wife and daughters,
and one may stare at him with all the
frankness of a compatriot. He is obviously
well-to-do,&mdash;else he would not be there at
all,&mdash;and the wife and daughters seem very
well-to-do indeed. He is kindly; considerate&mdash;sometimes
effusively considerate&mdash;of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
fellow travellers; patient with the ladies of his
family, who in turn are noticeably patient with
him. He is genial&mdash;very willing to talk with
polyglot headwaiters and chauffeurs; in fact
the wife and daughters are also practised conversationalists,
although their most loyal admirers
must admit that their voices <i>are</i> a trifle
sharp or flat. These ladies are more widely
read than "papa." He has not had much leisure
for Ruskin and Symonds and Ferrero.
His lack of historical training limits his curiosity
concerning certain phases of his European
surroundings; but he uses his eyes well upon
such general objects as trains, hotel-service,
and Englishmen. In spite of his habitual geniality,
he is rather critical of foreign ways,
although this is partly due to his lack of acquaintance
with them. Intellectually, he is
really more modest and self-distrustful than
his conversation or perhaps his general bearing
would imply; in fact, his wife and daughters,
emboldened very likely by the training of their
women's clubs, have a more commendable
daring in assaulting new intellectual positions.</p>

<p>Yet the American does not lack quickness,
either of wits or emotion. His humor and sentiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
make him an entertaining companion.
Even when his spirits run low, his patriotism
is sure to mount in proportion, and he can always
tell you with enthusiasm in just how many
days he expects to be back again in what he
calls "God's country."</p>

<p>This, or something like this, is the "American"
whom the European regards with curiosity,
contempt, admiration, or envy, as the case
may be, but who is incontestably modifying
Western Europe, even if he is not, as many
journalists and globe-trotters are fond of asserting,
"Americanizing" the world. Interesting
as it is to glance at him against that European
background which adds picturesqueness to his
qualities, the "Man from Home" is still more
interesting in his native habitat. There he has
been visited by hundreds of curious and observant
foreigners, who have left on record a whole
literature of bewildered and bewildering, irritating
and flattering and amusing testimony concerning
the Americans. Settlers like Crèvec&#339;ur
in the glowing dawn of the Republic, poets like
Tom Moore, novelists like Charles Dickens,&mdash;other
novelists like Mr. Arnold Bennett,&mdash;professional
travellers like Captain Basil Hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
students of contemporary sociology like Paul
Bourget and Mr. H. G. Wells, French journalists,
German professors, Italian admirers of
Colonel Roosevelt, political theorists like De
Tocqueville, profound and friendly observers
like Mr. Bryce, have had, and will continue to
have, their say.</p>

<p>The reader who tries to take all this testimony
at its face value, and to reconcile its contradictions,
will be a candidate for the insane
asylum. Yet the testimony is too amusing to
be neglected and some of it is far too important
to be ignored. Mr. John Graham Brooks, after
long familiarity with these foreign opinions of
America, has gathered some of the most representative
of them into a delightful and stimulating
volume entitled <i>As Others See Us</i>. There
one may find examples of what the foreigner
has seen, or imagined he has seen, during his
sojourn in America, and what he has said
about it afterwards. Mr. Brooks is too charitable
to our visitors to quote the most fantastic
and highly colored of their observations;
but what remains is sufficiently bizarre.</p>

<p>The real service of such a volume is to train
us in discounting the remarks made about us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
a particular period like the eighteen-thirties, or
from observations made in a special place, like
Newport, or under special circumstances, like a
Bishop's private car. It helps us to make allowances
for the inevitable angle of nationality, the
equally inevitable personal equation. A recent
ambitious book on America, by a Washington
journalist of long residence here, although of
foreign birth, declares that "the chief trait of
the American people is the love of gain and the
desire of wealth acquired through commerce."
That is the opinion of an expert observer, who
has had extraordinary chances for seeing precisely
what he has seen. I think it, notwithstanding,
a preposterous opinion, fully as preposterous
as Professor Muensterberg's notion
that America has latterly grown more monarchical
in its tendencies,&mdash;but I must remember
that, in my own case, as in that of the journalist
under consideration, there are allowances to be
made for race, and training, and natural idiosyncracy
of vision.</p>

<p>The native American, it may be well to remember,
is something of an observer himself.
If his observations upon the characteristics
of his countrymen are less piquant than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
foreigner's, it is chiefly because the American
writes, upon the whole, less incisively than he
talks. But incisive native writing about American
traits is not lacking. If a missionary, say in
South Africa, has read the New York <i>Nation</i>
every week for the past forty years, he has had
an extraordinary "moving picture" of American
tendencies, as interpreted by independent,
trenchant, and high-minded criticism.
That a file of the <i>Nation</i> will convey precisely
the same impression of American tendencies
as a file of the <i>Sun</i>, for instance, or the <i>Boston
Evening Transcript</i>, is not to be affirmed. The
humor of the London <i>Punch</i> and the New
York <i>Life</i> does not differ more radically than
the aspects of American civilization as viewed
by two rival journals in Newspaper Row. The
complexity of the material now collected and
presented in daily journalism is so great that
adequate editorial interpretation is obviously
impossible. All the more insistently does this
heterogeneous picture of American life demand
the impartial interpretation of the historian, the
imaginative transcription of the novelist. Humorist
and moralist, preacher and mob orator
and social essayist, shop-talk and talk over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
tea-cup or over the pipe, and the far more illuminating
instruction of events, are fashioning
day by day the infinitely delicate processes of
our national self-assessment. Scholars like Mr.
Henry Adams or Mr. James Ford Rhodes will
explain to us American life as it was during the
administrations of Jefferson or in the eighteen-fifties.
Professor Turner will expound the significance
of the frontier in American history.
Mr. Henry James will portray with unrivalled
psychological insight the Europeanized American
of the eighteen-seventies and eighties. Literary
critics like Professor Wendell or Professor
Trent will deduce from our literature itself evidence
concerning this or that national quality;
and all this mass of American expert testimony,
itself a result and a proof of national self-awareness
and self-respect, must be put into the scales
to balance, to confirm, or to outweigh the reports
furnished by foreigners.</p>

<p>I do not pretend to be able, like an expert
accountant, to draw up a balance-sheet of national
qualities, to credit or debit the American
character with this or that precise quantity
of excellence or defect. But having turned the
pages of many books about the United States,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and listened to many conversations about its
inhabitants in many states of the Union, I venture
to collect a brief list of the qualities which
have been assigned to us, together with a few,
but not, I trust, too many, of our admitted
national defects.</p>

<p>Like that excellent German who wrote the
History of the English Drama in six volumes,
I begin with Physical Geography. The differentiation
of the physical characteristics of our
branch of the English race is admittedly due,
in part, to climate. In spite of the immense
range of climatic variations as one passes from
New England to New Orleans, from the Mississippi
Valley to the high plains of the Far
West, or from the rainy Oregon belt southward
to San Diego, the settlers of English
stock find a prevalent atmospheric condition,
as a result of which they begin, in a generation
or two, to change in physique. They grow
thinner and more nervous, they "lean forward,"
as has been admirably said of them,
while the Englishman "leans back"; they are
less heavy and less steady; their voices are
higher, sharper; their athletes get more easily
"on edge"; they respond, in short, to an excessively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
stimulating climate. An old-fashioned
sea-captain put it all into a sentence when he
said that he could drink a bottle of wine with
his dinner in Liverpool and only a half a bottle
in New York. Explain the cause as we may,
the fact seems to be that the body of John
Bull changes, in the United States, into the
body of Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>There are mental differences no less pronounced.
No adjective has been more frequently
applied to the Anglo-Saxon than the
word "dull." The American mind has been
accused of ignorance, superficiality, levity, commonplaceness,
and dozens of other defects, but
"dulness" is not one of them. "Smartness,"
rather, is the preferred epithet of derogation;
or, to rise a little in the scale of valuation, it is
the word "cleverness," used with that lurking
contempt for cleverness which is truly English
and which long survived in the dialect of New
England, where the village ne'er-do-well or
Jack-of-all-trades used to be pronounced a
"clever" fellow. The variety of employments
to which the American pioneers were obliged
to betake themselves has done something, no
doubt, to produce a national versatility, a quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
assimilation of new methods and notions, a
ready adaptability to novel emergencies. An
invaluable pioneer trait is curiosity; the settler
in a new country, like Moses in the wilderness
of Arabia, must "turn aside to see"; he must
look into things, learn to read signs,&mdash;or else
the Indians or frost or freshet will soon put an
end to his pioneering. That curiosity concerning
strangers which so much irritated Dickens
and Mrs. Trollope was natural to the children
of Western emigrants to whom the difference
between Sioux and Pawnee had once meant
life or death. "What's your business, stranger,
in these parts?" was an instinctive, because it
had once been a vital, question. That it degenerates
into mere inquisitiveness is true enough;
just as the "acuteness," the "awareness," essential
to the existence of one generation becomes
only "cuteness," the typical tin-pedler's
habit of mind, in the generation following.</p>

<p>American inexperience, the national rawness
and unsophistication which has impressed so
many observers, has likewise its double significance
when viewed historically. We have
exhibited, no doubt, the amateurishness and
recklessness which spring from relative isolation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
from ignorance as to how they manage
elsewhere this particular sort of thing,&mdash;the
conservation of forests, let us say, or the government
of colonial dependencies. National
smugness and conceit, the impatience crystallized
in the phrase, "What have we got to do
with abroad?" have jarred upon the nerves of
many cultivated Americans. But it is no less
true that a nation of pioneers and settlers, like
the isolated individual, learns certain rough-and-ready
Robinson Crusoe ways of getting
things done. A California mining-camp is sure
to establish law and order in due time, though
never, perhaps, a law and order quite according
to Blackstone. In the most trying crises of
American political history, it was not, after all,
a question of profiting by European experience.
Washington and Lincoln, in their sorest
struggles, had nothing to do with "abroad";
the problem had first to be thought through,
and then fought through, in American and not
in European terms. Not a half-dozen Englishmen
understood the bearings of the Kansas-Nebraska
Bill, or, if they did, we were little the
wiser. We had to wait until a slow-minded
frontier lawyer mastered it in all its implications,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
and then patiently explained it to the
farmers of Illinois, to the United States, and
to the world.</p>

<p>It is true that the unsophisticated mode of
procedure may turn out to be sheer folly,&mdash;a
"sixteen to one" triumph of provincial barbarism.
But sometimes it is the secret of freshness
and of force. Your cross-country runner
scorns the highway, but that is because he has
confidence in his legs and loins, and he likes
to take the fences. Fenimore Cooper, when
he began to write stories, knew nothing about
the art of novel-making as practised in Europe,
but he possessed something infinitely
better for him, namely, instinct, and he took
the right road to the climax of a narrative as
unerringly as the homing bee follows its viewless
trail.</p>

<p>No one can be unaware how easily this
superb American confidence may turn to over-confidence,
to sheer recklessness. We love to
run past the signals, in our railroading and in
our thinking. Emerson will "plunge" on a
new idea as serenely as any stock-gambler ever
"plunged" in Wall Street, and a pretty school-teacher
will tell you that she has become an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
advocate of the "New Thought" as complacently
as an old financier will boast of having
bought Calumet and Hecla when it was selling
at 25. (Perhaps the school-teacher may get
as good a bargain. I cannot say.) Upon the
whole, Americans back individual guesswork
and pay cheerfully when they lose. A great
many of them, as it happens, have guessed
right. Even those who continue to guess
wrong, like Colonel Sellers, have the indefeasible
romantic appetite for guessing again. The
American temperament and the chances of
American history have brought constant temptation
to speculation, and plenty of our people
prefer to gamble upon what they love to call
a "proposition," rather than to go to the
bottom of the facts. They would rather speculate
than know.</p>

<p>Doubtless there are purely physical causes
that have encouraged this mental attitude,
such as the apparently inexhaustible resources
of a newly opened country, the consciousness
of youthful energy, the feeling that any
very radical mistake in pitching camp to-day
can easily be rectified when we pitch camp
to-morrow. The habit of exaggeration which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
was so particularly annoying to English visitors
in the middle of the last century&mdash;annoying
even to Charles Dickens, who was himself
something of an expert in exuberance&mdash;is
a physical and moral no less than a mental
quality. That monstrous braggadocio which
Dickens properly satirized in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>
was partly, of course, the product of
provincial ignorance. Doubtless there were,
and there are still, plenty of Pograms who are
convinced that Henry Clay and Daniel Webster
overtop all the intellectual giants of the
Old World. But that youthful bragging, and
perhaps some of the later bragging as well, has
its social side. It is a perverted idealism. It
springs from group loyalty, from sectional
fidelity. The settlement of "Eden" may be
precisely what Dickens drew it: a miasmatic
mud-hole. Yet we who are interested in the
new town do not intend, as the popular phrase
has it, "to give ourselves away." We back
our own "proposition," so that to this day
Chicago cannot tell the truth to St. Louis, nor
Harvard to Yale. Braggadocio thus gets glorified
through its rootage in loyalty; and likewise
extravagance&mdash;surely one of the worst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of American mental vices&mdash;is often based
upon a romantic confidence in individual opinion
or in the righteousness of some specific
cause. Convince a blue-blooded American like
Wendell Phillips that the abolition of slavery
is right, and, straightway, words and even facts
become to him mere weapons in a splendid
warfare. His statements grow rhetorical, reckless,
virulent. Proof seems to him, as it did to
the contemporary Transcendentalist philosophers,
an impertinence. The sole question is,
"Are you on the Lord's side?" i.e., on the
side of Wendell Phillips.</p>

<p>Excuse as we may the faults of a gifted
combatant in a moral crisis like the abolition
controversy, the fact remains that the intellectual
dangers of the oratorical temperament
are typically American. What is commonly
called our "Fourth of July" period has
indeed passed away. It has few apologists,
perhaps fewer than it really deserves. It is
possible to regret the disappearance of that
old-fashioned assertion of patriotism and pride,
and to question whether historical pageants
and a "noiseless Fourth" will develop any
better citizens than the fathers were. But on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the purely intellectual side, the influence of
that spread-eagle oratory was disastrous.
Throughout wide-extended regions of the
country, and particularly in the South and
West, the "orator" grew to be, in the popular
mind, the normal representative of intellectual
ability. Words, rather than things,
climbed into the saddle. Popular assemblies
were taught the vocabulary and the logic of
passion, rather than of sober, lucid reasoning.
The "stump" grew more potent than school-house
and church and bench; and it taught
its reckless and passionate ways to more than
one generation. The intellectual leaders of the
newer South have more than once suffered
ostracism for protesting against this glorification
of mere oratory. But it is not the South
alone that has suffered. Wherever a mob can
gather, there are still the dangers of the old
demagogic vocabulary and rhetoric. The mob
state of mind is lurking still in the excitable
American temperament.</p>

<p>The intellectual temptations of that temperament
are revealed no less in our popular journalism.
This journalism, it is needless to say,
is extremely able, but it is reckless to the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
degree. The extravagance of its head-lines and
the over-statements of its news columns are
direct sources of profit, since they increase the
circulation and it is circulation which wins
advertising space. I think it is fair to say that
the American people, as a whole, like precisely
the sort of journalism which they get. The
tastes of the dwellers in cities control, more
and more, the character of our newspapers.
The journals of New York, Chicago, and San
Francisco are steadily gaining in circulation, in
resourcefulness, and in public spirit, but they
are, for the most part, unscrupulous in attack,
sophistical, and passionate. They outvie the
popular pulpit in sentimentality. They play
with fire.</p>

<p>The note of exaggeration which is heard in
American oratory and journalism is struck
again in the popular magazines. Their campaign
of "exposure," during the last decade,
has been careless of individual and corporate
rights and reputations. Even the magazine
sketches and short stories are keyed up to a
hysteric pitch. So universally is this characteristic
national tension displayed in our periodical
literature that no one is much surprised to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
read in his morning paper that some one has
called the President of the United States a liar,&mdash;or
that some one has been called a liar by
the President of the United States.</p>

<p>For an explanation of these defects, shall we
fall back upon a convenient maxim of De
Tocqueville's and admit with him that "a democracy
is unsuited to meditation"? We are
forced to do so. But then comes the inevitable
second thought that a democracy must needs
have other things than meditation to attend to.
Athenian and Florentine and Versailles types
of political despotism have all proved highly
favorable to the lucubrations of philosophers
and men of letters who enjoyed the despot's
approbation. For that matter, no scheme of
life was ever better suited to meditation than
an Indian reservation in the eighteen-seventies,
with a Great Father in Washington to furnish
blankets, flour, and tobacco. Yet that is
not quite the American ideal of existence, and
it even failed to produce the peaceable fruits
of meditation in the Indian himself.</p>

<p>One may freely admit the shortcomings of
the American intelligence; the "commonness
of mind and tone" which Mr. Bryce believes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
to be inseparable from the presence of such
masses of men associated under modern democratic
government; the frivolity and extravagance
which represent the gasconading of the
romantic temper in face of the grey practicalities
of everyday routine; the provincial boastfulness
and bad taste which have resulted from
intellectual isolation; the lack, in short, of a
code, whether for thought or speech or behavior.
And nevertheless, one's instinctive Americanism
replies, May it not be better, after
all, to have gone without a code for a while, to
have lacked that orderly and methodized and
socialized European intelligence, and to have
had the glorious sense of bringing things to
pass in spite of it? There is just one thing that
would have been fatal to our democracy. It is
the feeling expressed in La Bruyère's famous
book: "Everything has been said, everything
has been written, everything has been done."
Here in America everything was to do; we
were forced to conjugate our verbs in the future
tense. No doubt our existence has been,
in some respects, one of barbarism, but it has
been the barbarism of life and not of death. A
rawboned baby sprawling on the mud floor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of a Kentucky log cabin is a more hopeful
spectacle than a wholly civilized funeral.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is," rejoins the European critic,
somewhat impatiently, "but you are confusing
the issue. We find certain grave defects in the
American mind, defects which, if you had not
had what Thomas Carlyle called 'a great deal
of land for a very few people,' would long ago
have involved you in disaster. You admit the
mental defects, but you promptly shift the
question to one of moral qualities, of practical
energy, of subduing your wilderness, and so
forth. You have too often absented yourself
from the wedding banquet, from the European
symposium of wit and philosophy, from the
polished and orderly and delightful play and
interplay of civilized mind,&mdash;and your excuse
is the old one: that you are trying your yoke
of oxen and cannot come. We charge you with
intellectual sins, and you enter the plea of
moral preoccupation. If you will permit personal
examples, you Americans have made ere
now your national heroes out of men whose
reasoning powers remained those of a college
sophomore, who were unable to state an opponent's
position with fairness, who lacked wholly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the judicial quality, who were vainglorious and
extravagant, who had, in short, the mind of an
exuberant barbarian; but you instantly forget
their intellectual defects in the presence of their
abounding physical and moral energy, their
freedom from any taint of personal corruption,
their whole-souled desire and effort for the
public good. Were not such heroes, impossible
as they would have been in any other civilized
country, perfectly illuminative of your
national state of mind?"</p>

<p>For one, I confess that I do not know what
reply to make to my imaginary European critic.
I suspect that he is right. At any rate, we stand
here at the fork of the road. If we do not wish to
linger any longer over a catalogue of intellectual
sins, let us turn frankly to our moral preoccupations,
comforting ourselves, if we like, as we
abandon the field of purely intellectual rivalry
with Europe, in the reflection that it is the
muddle-headed Anglo-Saxon, after all, who is
the dominant force in the modern world.</p>

<p>The moral temper of the American people
has been analyzed no less frequently than their
mental traits. Foreign and native observers are
alike agreed in their recognition of the extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
American energy. The sheer power
of the American bodily machine, driven by the
American will, is magnificent. It is often driven
too hard, and with reckless disregard of anything
save immediate results. It wears out more
quickly than the bodily machine of the Englishman.
It is typical that the best distance runners
of Great Britain usually beat ours, while we beat
them in the sprints. Our public men are frequently&mdash;as
the athletes say&mdash;"all in" at
sixty. Their energy is exhausted at just the time
that many an English statesman begins his best
public service. But after making every allowance
for wasteful excess, for the restless and impatient
consumption of nervous forces which
nature intended that we should hold in reserve,
the fact remains that American history has demonstrated
the existence of a dynamic national
energy, physical and moral, which is still unabated.
Immigration has turned hitherward the
feet of millions upon millions of young men
from the hardiest stocks of Europe. They replenish
the slackening streams of vigor. When
the northern New Englander cannot make a
living on the old farm, the French Canadian
takes it off his hands, and not only improves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the farm, but raises big crops of boys. So with
Italians, Swedes, Germans, Irish, Jews, and
Portuguese, and all the rest. We are a nation
of immigrants, a digging, hewing, building,
breeding, bettering race, of mixed blood and
varying creeds, but of fundamental faith in the
wages of going on; a race compounded of materials
crude but potent; raw, but with blood
that is red and bones that are big; a race that is
accomplishing its vital tasks, and, little by little,
transmuting brute forces and material energies
into the finer play of mind and spirit.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, the American
people have been characterized by idealism. It
was the inner light of Pilgrim and Quaker colonists;
it gleams no less in the faces of the children
of Russian Jew immigrants to-day. American
irreverence has been noted by many a foreign
critic, but there are certain subjects in
whose presence our reckless or cynical speech
is hushed. Compared with current Continental
humor, our characteristic American humor is
peculiarly reverent. The purity of woman and
the reality of religion are not considered topics
for jocosity. Cleanness of body and of mind are
held by our young men to be not only desirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
but attainable virtues. There is among us, in
comparison with France or Germany, a defective
reverence for the State as such; and a
positive irreverence towards the laws of the
Commonwealth, and towards the occupants of
high political positions. Mayor, Judge, Governor,
Senator, or even President, may be the
butt of such indecorous ridicule as shocks or
disgusts the foreigner; but nevertheless the
personal joke stops short of certain topics which
Puritan tradition disapproves. The United
States is properly called a Christian nation,
not merely because the Supreme Court has so
affirmed it, but because the phrase "a Christian
nation" expresses the historical form which
the religious idealism of the country has made
its own. The Bible is still considered, by the
mass of the people, a sacred book; oaths in
courts of law, oaths of persons elected to great
office, are administered upon it. American
faith in education, as all the world knows, has
from the beginning gone hand in hand with
faith in religion; the school-house was almost
as sacred a symbol as the meeting-house; and
the munificence of American private benefactions
to the cause of education furnishes to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
one of the most striking instances of idealism
in the history of civilization.</p>

<p>The ideal passions of patriotism, of liberty,
of loyalty to home and section, of humanitarian
and missionary effort, have all burned with a
clear flame in the United States. The optimism
which lies so deeply embedded in the
American character is one phase of the national
mind. Charles Eliot Norton once said
to me, with his dry humor, that there was an
infallible test of the American authorship of
any anonymous article or essay: "Does it contain
the phrase 'After all, we need not despair'?
If it does, it was written by an American."
In spite of all that is said about the
practicality of the American, his love of gain
and his absorption in material interests, those
who really know him are aware how habitually
he confronts his practical tasks in a spirit of
romantic enthusiasm. He marches downtown
to his prosaic day's job and calls it "playing
the game"; to work as hard as he can is to
"get into the game," and to work as long as
he can is to "stay in the game"; he loves to
win fully as much as the Jew and he hates to
lose fully as much as the Englishman, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
losing or winning, he carries into his business
activity the mood of the idealist.</p>

<p>It is easy to think of all this as self-deception
as the emotional effusiveness of the
American temperament; but to refuse to see
its idealism is to mistake fundamentally the
character of the American man. No doubt he
does deceive himself often as to his real motives:
he is a mystic and a bargain-hunter by
turns. Divided aims, confused ideals, have
struggled for the mastery among us, ever since
Challon's <i>Voyage</i>, in 1606, announced that the
purpose of the first colonists to Virginia was
"both to seek to convert the savages, as also
to seek out what benefits or commodities
might be had in those parts." How that
"both"&mdash;"as also" keeps echoing in American
history: "both" to christianize the Negro
and work him at a profit, "both" duty and
advantage in retaining the Philippines; "both"
international good will and increased armaments;
"both" Sunday morning precepts and
Monday morning practice; "both" horns of
a dilemma; "both God and mammon"; did
ever a nation possess a more marvellous
water-tight compartment method of believing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and honoring opposites! But in all this unconscious
hypocrisy the American is perhaps
not worse&mdash;though he may be more absurd!&mdash;than
other men.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the American mind is
found in our radicalism. "To be an American,"
it has been declared, "is to be a radical."
That statement needs qualification. Intellectually
the American is inclined to radical views;
he is willing to push certain social theories
very far; he will found a new religion, a new
philosophy, a new socialistic community, at
the slightest notice or provocation; but he has
at bottom a fund of moral and political conservatism.
Thomas Jefferson, one of the greatest
of our radical idealists, had a good deal of
the English squire in him after all. Jeffersonianism
endures, not merely because it is a radical
theory of human nature, but because it
expresses certain facts of human nature. The
American mind looks forward, not back; but
in practical details of land, taxes, and governmental
machinery we are instinctively cautious
of change. The State of Connecticut knows
that her constitution is ill adapted to the present
conditions of her population, but the difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
is to persuade the rural legislators to
amend it. Yet everybody admits that amendment
will come "some day." This admission
is a characteristic note of American feeling;
and every now and then come what we call
"uplift" movements, when radicalism is in
the very air, and a thousand good "causes"
take fresh vigor.</p>

<p>One such period was in the New England
of the eighteen-forties. We are moving in a
similar&mdash;only this time a national&mdash;current
of radicalism, to-day. But a change in the
weather or the crops has before now turned
many of our citizens from radicalism into conservatism.
There is, in fact, conservatism in
our blood and radicalism in our brains, and
now one and now the other rules. Very typical
of American radicalism is that story of the
old sea-captain who was ignorant, as was supposed,
of the science of navigation, and who
cheerfully defended himself by saying that he
could work his vessel down to Boston Light
without knowing any navigation, and after that
he could go where he "dum pleased." I suspect
the old fellow pulled his sextant and
chronometer out of his chest as soon as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
really needed them. American radicalism is
not always as innocent of the world's experience
as it looks. In fact, one of the most
interesting phases of this twentieth century
"uplift" movement is its respect and even
glorification of expert opinion. A German expert
in city-planning electrifies an audience of
Chicago club-women by talking to them about
drains, ash-carts, and flower-beds. A hundred
other experts, in sanitation, hygiene, chemistry,
conservation of natural resources, government
by commission, tariffs, arbitration treaties,
are talking quite as busily; and they have
the attention of a national audience that is
listening with genuine modesty, and with a real
desire to refashion American life on wiser and
nobler plans. In this national forward movement
in which we are living, radicalism has
shown its beneficent aspect of constructive
idealism.</p>

<p>No catalogue of American qualities and defects
can exclude the trait of individualism.
We exalt character over institutions, says Mr.
Brownell; we like our institutions because they
suit us, and not because we admire institutions.
"Produce great persons," declares Walt Whitman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
"the rest follows." Whether the rest follows
or not, there can be no question that
Americans, from the beginning, have laid singular
stress upon personal qualities. The religion
and philosophy of the Puritans were in
this respect at one with the gospel of the frontier.
It was the principle of "every man for
himself"; solitary confrontation of his God,
solitary struggle with the wilderness. "He
that will not work," declared John Smith after
that first disastrous winter at Jamestown,
"neither let him eat." The pioneer must
clear his own land, harvest his own crops,
defend his own fireside; his temporal and
eternal salvation were strictly his own affair.
He asked, and expected, no aid from the community;
he could at most "change works"
in time of harvest, with a neighbor, if he had
one. It was the sternest school of self-reliance,
from babyhood to the grave, that human
society is ever likely to witness. It bred heroes
and cranks and hermits; its glories and
its eccentricities are written in the pages of
Emerson, Thoreau, and Whitman; they are
written more permanently still in the instinctive
American faith in individual manhood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Our democracy idolizes a few individuals; it
ignores their defective training, or, it may be,
their defective culture; it likes to think of an
Andrew Jackson who was a "lawyer, judge,
planter, merchant, general, and politician," before
he became President; it asks only that the
man shall not change his individual character
in passing from one occupation or position to
another; in fact, it is amused and proud to
think of Grant hauling cordwood to market, of
Lincoln keeping store or Roosevelt rounding-up
cattle. The one essential question was
put by Hawthorne into the mouth of Holgrave
in the <i>House of the Seven Gables</i>. Holgrave had
been by turns a schoolmaster, clerk in a store,
editor, pedler, lecturer on Mesmerism, and
daguerreotypist, but "amid all these personal
vicissitudes," says Hawthorne, "he had never
lost his identity.... He had never violated
the innermost man, but had carried his conscience
along with him." There speaks the
local accent of Puritanism, but the voice insisting
upon the moral integrity of the individual
is the undertone of America.</p>

<p>Finally, and surely not the least notable of
American traits, is public spirit. Triumphant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
individualism checks itself, or is rudely checked
in spite of itself, by considerations of the general
good. How often have French critics confessed,
with humiliation, that in spite of the
superior socialization of the French intelligence,
France has yet to learn from America the art
and habit of devoting individual fortunes to
the good of the community. Our American
literature, as has been already pointed out, is
characteristically a citizen literature, responsive
to the civic note, the production of men who,
like the writers of the <i>Federalist</i>, applied a vigorous
practical intelligence, a robust common
sense, to questions affecting the interest of
everybody. The spirit of fair play in our free
democracy has led Americans to ask not merely
what is right and just for one, the individual,
but what are righteousness and justice and fair
play for all. Democracy, as embodied in such
a leader as Lincoln, has meant Fellowship.
Nothing finer can be said of a representative
American than to say of him, as Mr. Norton
said of Mr. Lowell, that he had a "most public
soul."</p>

<p>No one can present such a catalogue of
American qualities as I have attempted without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
realizing how much escapes his classification.
Conscious criticism and assessment of national
characteristics is essential to an understanding
of them; but one feels somehow that the net is
not holding. The analysis of English racial inheritances,
as modified by historical conditions,
yields much, no doubt; but what are we to say
of such magnificent embodiments of the American
spirit as are revealed in the Swiss immigrant
Agassiz, the German exile Carl Schurz,
the native-born mulatto Booker Washington?
The Americanism of representative Americans
is something which must be felt; it is to be
reached by imaginative perception and sympathy,
no less than by the process of formal
analysis. It would puzzle the experts in racial
tendencies to find arithmetically the common
denominator of such American figures as Franklin,
Washington, Jackson, Webster, Lee, Lincoln,
Emerson, and "Mark Twain"; yet the
countrymen of those typical Americans instinctively
recognize in them a sort of largeness,
genuineness, naturalness, kindliness, humor,
effectiveness, idealism, which are indubitably
and fundamentally American.</p>

<p>There are certain sentiments of which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
ourselves are conscious, though we can scarcely
translate them into words, and these vaguely
felt emotions of admiration, of effort, of fellowship
and social faith are the invisible America.
Take, for a single example, the national admiration
for what we call a "self-made" man: here
is a boy selling candy and newspapers on a
Michigan Central train; he makes up his mind
to be a lawyer; in twelve years from that day
he is general counsel for the Michigan Central
road; he enters the Senate of the United States
and becomes one of its leading figures. The instinctive
flush of sympathy and pride with which
Americans listen to such a story is far more
deeply based than any vulgar admiration for
money-making abilities. No one cares whether
such a man is rich or poor. He has vindicated
anew the possibilities of manhood under American
conditions of opportunity; the miracle of
our faith has in him come true once more.</p>

<p>No one can understand America with his
brains. It is too big, too puzzling. It tempts,
and it deceives. But many an illiterate immigrant
has felt the true America in his pulses
before he ever crossed the Atlantic. The descendant
of the Pilgrims still remains ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of our national life if he does not respond to its
glorious zest, its throbbing energy, its forward
urge, its uncomprehending belief in the future,
its sense of the fresh and mighty world just
beyond to-day's horizon. Whitman's "Pioneers,
O Pioneers" is one of the truest of
American poems because it beats with the pulse
of this onward movement, because it is full of
this laughing and conquering fellowship and
of undefeated faith.</p>

American Idealism</h2>


<p>Our endeavor to state the general characteristics
of the American mind has already given
us some indication of what Americans really
care for. The things or the qualities which
they like, the objects of their conscious or unconscious
striving, are their ideals. "There
is what I call the American idea," said Theodore
Parker in the Anti-Slavery Convention
of 1850. "This idea demands, as the proximate
organization thereof, a democracy&mdash;that
is, a government of all the people, by all the
people, for all the people; of course, a government
on the principle of eternal justice, the
unchanging law of God; for shortness' sake, I
will call it the idea of Freedom." That is one
of a thousand definitions of American idealism.
Books devoted to the "Spirit of America"&mdash;like
the volume by Henry van Dyke which
bears that very title&mdash;give a programme of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
national accomplishments and aspirations. But
our immediate task is more specific. It is to
point out how adequately this idealistic side of
the national temperament has been expressed
in American writing. Has our literature kept
equal pace with our thinking and feeling?</p>

<p>We do not need, in attempting to answer
this question, any definition of idealism, in its
philosophical or in its more purely literary
sense. There are certain fundamental human
sentiments which lift men above brutes, Frenchmen
above "frog-eaters," and Englishmen
above "shop-keepers." These ennobling sentiments
or ideals, while universal in their essential
nature, assume in each civilized nation a
somewhat specific coloring. The national literature
reveals the myriad shades and hues of
private and public feeling, and the more truthful
this literary record, the more delicate and
noble become the harmonies of local and national
thought or emotion with the universal
instincts and passions of mankind. On the
other hand, when the literature of Spain, for
instance, or of Italy, fails, within a given period,
in range and depth of human interest, we are
compelled to believe either that the Spain or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Italy of that age was wanting in the nobler
ideals, or that it lacked literary interpretation.</p>

<p>In the case of America we are confronted by
a similar dilemma. Since the beginning of the
seventeenth century this country has been, in
a peculiar sense, the home of idealism; but our
literature has remained through long periods
thin and provincial, barren in cosmopolitan
significance; and the hard fact faces us to-day
that only three or four of our writers have
aroused any strong interest in the cultivated
readers of continental Europe. Evidently, then,
either the torch of American idealism does not
burn as brightly as we think, or else our writers,
with but few exceptions, have not hitherto
possessed the height and reach and grasp to
hold up the torch so that the world could see
it. Let us look first at the flame, and then at
the torch-bearers.</p>

<p>Readers of Carlyle have often been touched
by the humility with which that disinherited
child of Calvinism speaks of Goethe's doctrine
of the "Three Reverences," as set forth in <i>Wilhelm
Meister</i>. Again and again, in his correspondence
and his essays, does Carlyle recur
to that teaching of the threefold Reverence:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Reverence for what is above us, for what is
around us and for what is under us; that is to
say, the ethnic religion which frees us from debasing
fear, the philosophical religion which
unites us with our comrades, and the Christian
religion which recognizes humility and poverty
and suffering as divine.</p>

<p>"To which of these religions do you specially
adhere?" inquired Wilhelm.</p>

<p>"To all the three," replied the sages; "for
in their union they produce what may properly
be called the true Religion. Out of those three
Reverences springs the highest Reverence,
Reverence for Oneself."</p>

<p>An admirable symbolism, surely; vaguer,
no doubt, than the old symbols which Carlyle
had learned in the Kirk at Ecclefechan, but
less vague, in turn, than that doctrine of reverence
for the Oversoul, which was soon to be
taught at Concord.</p>

<p>As one meditates upon the idealism of the
first colonists in America, one is tempted to ask
what their "reverences" were. Toward what
tangible symbols of the invisible did their eyes
instinctively turn?</p>

<p>For New England, at least, the answer is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
relatively simple. One form of it is contained
in John Adams's well-known prescription for
Virginia, as recorded in his <i>Diary</i> for July 21,
1786. "Major Langbourne dined with us
again. He was lamenting the difference of character
between Virginia and New England. I
offered to give him a receipt for making a New
England in Virginia. He desired it; and I recommended
to him town-meetings, training-days,
town-schools, and ministers."</p>

<p>The "ministers," it will be noticed, come
last on the Adams list. But the order of precedence
is unimportant.</p>

<p>Here are four symbols, or, if you like, "reverences."
Might not the Virginia planters,
loyal to their own specific symbol of the "gentleman,"&mdash;no
unworthy ideal, surely; one
that had been glorified in European literature
ever since Castiligione wrote his <i>Courtier</i>, and
one that had been transplanted from England
to Virginia as soon as Sir Walter Raleigh's men
set foot on the soil which took its name from
the Virgin Queen,&mdash;might not the Virginia
gentlemen have pondered to their profit over
the blunt suggestion of the Massachusetts commoner?
No doubt; and yet how much picturesqueness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
and nobility&mdash;and tragedy, too&mdash;we
should have missed, if our history had not
been full of these varying symbols, clashing
ideals, different Reverences!</p>

<p>One Reverence, at least, was common to the
Englishman of Virginia and to the Englishman
of Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay. They
were joint heirs of the Reformation, children of
that waxing and puissant England which was a
nation of one book, the Bible; a book whose
phrases color alike the <i>Faerie Queen</i> of Spenser
and the essays of Francis Bacon; a book
rich beyond all others in human experience;
full of poetry, history, drama; the test of conduct;
the manual of devotion; and above all,
and blinding all other considerations by the
very splendor of the thought, a book believed
to be the veritable Word of the unseen God.
For these colonists in the wilderness, as for the
Protestant Europe which they had left irrevocably
behind them, the Bible was the plainest
of all symbols of idealism: it was the first of
the "Reverences."</p>

<p>The Church was a symbol likewise, but to
the greater portion of colonial America the
Church meant chiefly the tangible band of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
militant believers within the limits of a certain
township or parish, rather than the mystical
Bride of Christ. Except in Maryland and Virginia,
whither the older forms of Church worship
were early transplanted, there was scanty
reverence for the Establishment. There was
neither clergyman nor minister on board the
Mayflower. In Rufus Choate's oration on the
Pilgrims before the New England Society of
New York in 1843, occurred the famous sentence
about "a church without a bishop and a
state without a King"; to which Dr. Wainwright,
rector of St. John's, replied wittily at
the dinner following the oration that there
"can be no church without a bishop." This is
perhaps a question for experts; but Thomas
Hooker, Thomas Shepard, and John Cotton
would have sided with Rufus Choate. The awe
which had once been paid to the Establishment
was transferred, in the seventeenth-century
New England, to the minister. The minister
imposed himself upon the popular imagination,
partly through sheer force of personal ascendency,
and partly as a symbol of the theocracy,&mdash;the
actual governing of the Commonwealth
by the laws and spirit of the sterner Scriptures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
The minister dwelt apart as upon an awful
Sinai. It was no mere romantic fancy of Hawthorne
that shadowed his countenance with a
black veil. The church organization, too,&mdash;though
it may have lacked its bishop,&mdash;had
a despotic power over its communicants; to be
cast out of its fellowship involved social and
political consequences comparable to those following
excommunication by the Church of
Rome. Hawthorne and Whittier and Longfellow&mdash;all
of them sound antiquarians,
though none of them in sympathy with the
theology of Puritanism&mdash;have described in
fit terms the bareness of the New England
meeting-house. What intellectual severity and
strain was there; what prodigality of learning;
what blazing intensity of devotion; what pathos
of women's patience, and of children, prematurely
old, stretched upon the rack of insoluble
problems! What dramas of the soul were
played through to the end in those barn-like
buildings, where the musket, perhaps, stood in
the corner of the pew! "How aweful is this
place!" must have been murmured by the
lips of all; though there were many who have
added, "This is the gate of Heaven."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>The gentler side of colonial religion is winningly
portrayed in Whittier's <i>Pennsylvania
Pilgrim</i> and in his imaginary journal of Margaret
Smith. There were sunnier slopes, warmer
exposures for the ripening of the human spirit,
in the Southern colonies. Even in New England
there was sporadic revolt from the beginning.
The number of non-church-members increased
rapidly after 1700; Franklin as a youth
in Boston admired Cotton Mather's ability, but
he did not go to church, "Sunday being my
studying day." Doubtless there were always
humorous sceptics like Mrs. Stowe's delightful
Sam Lawson in <i>Oldtown Folks</i>. Lawson's
comment on Parson Simpson's service epitomizes
two centuries of New England thinking.
"Wal," said Sam, "Parson Simpson's a smart
man; but I tell ye, it's kind o' discouragin'.
Why, he said our state and condition by natur
was just like this. We was clear down in a well
fifty feet deep, and the sides all round nothin'
but glare ice; but we was under immediate obligations
to get out, 'cause we was free, voluntary
agents. But nobody ever had got out, and
nobody would, unless the Lord reached down
and took 'em. And whether he would or not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
nobody could tell; it was all sovereignty. He
said there wan't one in a hundred, not one in
a thousand,&mdash;not one in ten thousand,&mdash;that
would be saved. Lordy massy, says I to myself,
ef that's so they're any of 'em welcome to my
chance. <i>And so I kind o' ris up and come out.</i>"</p>

<p>Mrs. Stowe's novel is fairly representative
of a great mass of derivative literature which
draws its materials from the meeting-house
period of American history. But the direct literature
of that period has passed almost wholly
into oblivion. Jonathan Edwards had one of
the finest minds of his century; no European
standard of comparison is too high for him; he
belongs with Pascal, with Augustine, if you like,
with Dante. But his great treatises written in
the Stockbridge woods are known only to a few
technical students of philosophy. One terrible
sermon, preached at Enfield in 1741, is still
read by the curious; but scarcely anybody knows
of the ineffable tenderness, dignity, and pathos
of his farewell sermon to his flock at Northampton:
and the Yale Library possesses nearly
twelve hundred of Edwards's sermons which
have never been printed at all. Nor does anybody,
save here and there an antiquarian, read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Shepard and Hooker and Mayhew. And yet
these preachers and their successors furnished
the emotional equivalents of great prose and
verse to generations of men. "That is poetry,"
says Professor Saintsbury (in a dangerous latitudinarianism,
perhaps!), "which gives the
reader the feeling of poetry." Here we touch
one of the fundamental characteristics of our
national state of mind, in its relation to literature.
We are careless of form and type, yet we
crave the emotional stimulus. Milton, greatest
of Puritan poets, was read and quoted all too
seldom in the Puritan colonies, and yet those
colonists were no strangers to the emotions of
sublimity and awe and beauty. They found
them in the meeting-house instead of in a book;
precisely as, in a later day, millions of Americans
experienced what was for them the emotional
equivalent of poetry in the sermons of
Henry Ward Beecher and Phillips Brooks.
French pulpit oratory of the seventeenth century
wins recognition as a distinct type of literature;
its great practitioners, like Massillon,
Bourdaloue, Bossuet, are appraised in all the
histories of the national literature and in books
devoted to the evolution of literary species. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the American colonies the great preachers performed
the functions of men of letters without
knowing it. They have been treated with too
scant respect in the histories of American literature.
It is one of the penalties of Protestantism
that the audiences, after a while, outgrow
the preacher. The development of the
historic sense, of criticism, of science, makes an
impassable gulf between Jonathan Edwards
and the American churches of the twentieth
century. A sense of profound changes in theology
has left our contemporaries indifferent to
the literature in which the old theology was
clothed.</p>

<p>There is one department of American literary
production, of which Bossuet's famous sermon
on Queen Henrietta Maria of England
may serve to remind us, which illustrates significantly
the national idealism. I mean the
commemorative oration. The addresses upon
the Pilgrim Fathers by such orators as Everett,
Webster, and Choate; the countless orations
before such organizations as the New England
Society of New York and the Phi Beta Kappa;
the papers read before historical and patriotic
societies; the birthday and centenary discourses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
upon national figures like Washington or Lincoln,
have all performed, and are still performing,
an inestimable service in stimulating popular
loyalty to the idealism of the fathers. As
literature, most of this production is derivative:
we listen to eloquence about the Puritans, but
we do not read the Puritans; the description
of Arthur Dimmesdale's election sermon in
<i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, moving as it may be, tempts
no one to open the stout collections of election
sermons in the libraries. Yet the original literature
of mediæval chivalry is known only to
a few scholars: Tennyson's <i>Idylls</i> outsell the
<i>Mabinogion</i> and Malory. The actual world of
literature is always shop-worn; a world chiefly
of second-hand books, of warmed-over emotions
and it is not surprising that many listeners
to orations about Lincoln do not personally
emulate Lincoln, and that many of the most
enthusiastic dealers in the sentiment of the ancestral
meeting-house do not themselves attend
church.</p>

<p>The other ingredients of John Adams's ideal
Commonwealth are no less significant of our
national disposition. Take the school-house.
It was planted in the wilderness for the training<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of boys and girls and for a future "godly and
learned ministry." The record of American
education is a long story of idealism which has
touched literature at every turn. The "red
school-house" on the hill-top or at the cross-roads,
the "log-colleges" in forgotten hamlets,
the universities founded by great states, are all
a record of the American faith&mdash;which has
sometimes been called a fetich&mdash;in education.
In its origin, it was a part of the essential programme
of Calvinism to make a man able to
judge for himself upon the most momentous
questions; a programme, too, of that political
democracy which lay embedded in the tenets
of Calvinism, a democracy which believes and
must continue to believe that an educated electorate
can safeguard its own interests and train
up its own leaders. The poetry of the American
school-house was written long ago by Whittier,
in describing Joshua Coffin's school under
the big elm on the cross-road in East Haverhill;
its humor and pathos and drama have been
portrayed by innumerable story-writers and essayists.
Mrs. Martha Baker Dunn's charming
sketches, entitled "Cicero in Maine" and "Virgil
in Maine," indicate the idealism once taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
in the old rural academies,&mdash;and it is taught
there still. City men will stop wistfully on the
street, in the first week of September, to watch
the boys and girls go trudging off to their first
day of school; men who believe in nothing else
at least believe in that! And school and college
and university remain, as in the beginning, the
first garden-ground and the last refuge of literature.</p>

<p>That "town-meeting" which John Adams
thought Virginia might do well to adopt has
likewise become a symbol of American idealism.
Together with the training-day, it represented
the rights and duties and privileges of
free men; the machinery of self-government.
It was democracy, rather than "representative"
government, under its purest aspect. Sentiments
of responsibility to the town, the political unit,
and to the Commonwealth, the group of units,
were bred there. Likewise, it was a training-school
for sententious speech and weighty
action; its roots, as historians love to demonstrate,
run back very far; and though the modern
drift to cities has made its machinery ineffective
in the larger communities, it remains a perpetual
spring or feeding stream to the broader currents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
of our national life. Without an understanding
of the town-meeting and its equivalents,
our political literature loses much of its
significance. Like the school-house and meeting-house,
it has become glorified by our men
of letters. John Fiske and other historians
have celebrated it in some of the most brilliant
pages of our political writing; and that
citizen literature, so deeply characteristic of us,
found in the plain, forthright, and public-spirited
tone of town-meeting discussions its keynote.
The spectacular debates of our national
history, the dramatic contests in the great arena
of the Senate Chamber, the discussions before
huge popular audiences in the West, have maintained
the civic point of view, have developed
and dignified and enriched the prose style first
employed by American freemen in deciding
their local affairs in the presence of their neighbors.
"I am a part of this people," said Lincoln
proudly in one of his famous debates of
1858; "I was raised just a little east of here";
and this nearness to the audience, this directness
and simplicity and genuineness of our best political
literature, its homely persuasiveness and
force, is an inheritance of the town-meeting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>Bible and meeting-house, school-house and
town-meeting, thus illustrate concretely the
responsiveness of the American character to
idealistic impulses. They are external symbols
of a certain state of mind. It may indeed be
urged that they are primarily signs of a moral
and social or institutional trend, and are therefore
non-literary evidence of American idealism.
Nevertheless, institutional as they may be
deemed, they lie close to that poetry of daily
duty in which our literature has not been poor.
They are fundamentally related to that attitude
of mind, that habitual temper of the spirit,
which has produced, in all countries of settled
use and wont, the literature of idealism. Brunetière
said of Flaubert's most famous woman
character that poor Emma Bovary, the prey
and the victim of Romantic desires, was after
all much like the rest of us except that she
lacked the intelligence to perceive the charm
and poetry of the daily task. We have already
touched upon the purely romantic side of
American energy and of American imagination,
and we must shortly look more closely
still at those impulses of daring, those moods
of heightened feeling, that intensified individualism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the quest of strangeness and terror and
wild beauty, which characterize our romantic
writing. But this romanticism is, as it were, a
segment of the larger circle of idealism. It is
idealism accentuated by certain factors, driven
to self-expression by the passions of scorn or
of desire; it exceeds, in one way or another,
the normal range of experience and emotion.
Our romantic American literature is doubtless
our greatest. And yet some of the most characteristic
tendencies of American writing are to
be found in the poetry of daily experience, in
the quiet accustomed light that falls upon one's
own doorway and garden, in the immemorial
charm of going forth to one's labor and returning
in the evening,&mdash;poetry old as the world.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Let us see how this glow of idealism touches
some of the more intimate aspects of human experience.
"Out of the three Reverences," says
Wilhelm Meister, "springs the highest Reverence,
Reverence for Oneself." Open the
pages of Hawthorne. Moving wholly within
the framework of established institutions, with
no desire to shatter the existing scheme of
social order, choosing as its heroes men of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
meeting-house, town-meeting, and training-day,
how intensely nevertheless does the imagination
of this fiction-writer illuminate the Body
and the Soul!</p>

<p>Take first the Body. The inheritance of
English Puritanism may be traced throughout
our American writing, in its reverence for physical
purity. The result is something unique in
literary history. Continental critics, while recognizing
the intellectual and artistic powers
revealed in <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, have seldom
realized the awfulness, to the Puritan mind,
of the very thought of an adulterous minister.
That a priest in southern Europe should break
his vows is indeed scandalous; but the sin is regarded
as a failure of the natural man to keep
a vow requiring supernatural grace for its fulfilment;
it may be that the priest had no vocation
for his sacred office; he is unfrocked, punished,
forgotten, yet a certain mantle of human
charity still covers his offence. But in the Puritan
scheme (and <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, save for
that one treacherous, warm human moment in
the woodland where "all was spoken," lies
wholly within the set framework of Puritanism)
there is no forgiveness for a sin of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
flesh. There is only Law, Law stretching on
into infinitude until the mind shudders at it.
Hawthorne knew his Protestant New England
through and through. <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> is the
most striking example in our national literature
of that idealization of physical purity, but hundreds
of other romances and poems, less morbid
if less great, assert in unmistakable terms
the same moral conviction, the same ideal.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of its theme, there was never a
less adulterous novel than this book which plays
so artistically with the letter A. The body is
branded, is consumed, is at last, perhaps, transfigured
by the intense rays of light emitted from
the suffering soul.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The soul is form and doth the body make."</p></blockquote>

<p>In this intense preoccupation with the Soul,
Hawthorne's romance is in unison with the
more mystical and spiritual utterances of Catholicism
as well as of Protestantism. It was in
part a resultant of that early American isolation
which contributed so effectively to the artistic
setting of <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>. But in his
doctrine of spiritual integrity, in the agonized
utterance, "Be true&mdash;be true!" as well as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
his reverence for purity of the body, our greatest
romancer was typical of the imaginative literature
of his countrymen. The restless artistic
experiments of Poe presented the human body
in many a ghastly and terrifying aspect of illness
and decay, and distorted by all passions
save one. His imagination was singularly sexless.
Pathological students have pointed out
the relation between this characteristic of Poe's
writing, and his known tendencies toward opium-eating,
alcoholism, and tuberculosis. But
no such explanation is at hand to elucidate the
absence of sexual passion from the novels of
the masculine-minded Fenimore Cooper. One
may say, indeed, that Cooper's novels, like
Scott's, lack intensity of spiritual vision; that
their tone is consonant with the views of a sound
Church of England parson in the eighteenth
century; and that the absence of physical passion,
like the absence of purely spiritual insight,
betrays a certain defect in Cooper's imaginative
grasp and depth. But it is better criticism, after
all, to remember that these three pioneers in
American fiction-writing were composing for
an audience in which Puritan traditions or tastes
were predominant. Not one of the three men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
but would have instantly sacrificed an artistic
effect, legitimate in the eyes of Fielding or
Goethe or Balzac, rather than&mdash;in the phrase
so often satirized&mdash;"bring a blush to the cheek
of innocence." In other words, the presence
of a specific audience, accustomed to certain
Anglo-Saxon and Puritanic restraint of topic
and of speech, has from the beginning of our
imaginative literature coöperated with the instinct
of our writers. That Victorian reticence
which is so plainly seen even in such full-bodied
writers as Dickens or Thackeray&mdash;a reticence
which men like Mr. Bernard Shaw and Mr.
Galsworthy and Mr. Wells think so hypocritical
and dangerous to society and which they
have certainly done their utmost to abolish&mdash;has
hitherto dominated our American writing.
The contemporary influence of great Continental
writers to whom reticence is unknown,
combined with the influence of a contemporary
opera and drama to which reticence would be
unprofitable, are now assaulting this dominant
convention. Very possibly it is doomed. But
it is only within recent years that its rule has
been questioned.</p>

<p>One result of it may, I think, be fairly admitted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
While very few writers of eminence,
after all, in any country, wish to bring a "blush
to the cheek of innocence," they naturally wish,
as Thackeray put it in one of the best-known
of his utterances, to be permitted to depict a
man to the utmost of their power. American
literary conventions, like English conventions,
have now and again laid a restraining and compelling
hand upon the legitimate exercise of this
artistic instinct; and this fact has coöperated
with many social, ethical, and perhaps physiological
causes to produce a thinness or bloodlessness
in our books. They are graceful, pleasing,
but pale, like one of those cool whitish
uncertain skies of an American spring. They
lack "body," like certain wines. It is not often
that we can produce a real Burgundy. We have
had many distinguished fiction-writers, but none
with the physical gusto of a Fielding, a Smollett,
or even a Dickens, who, idealist and romanticist
as he was, and Victorian as were his
artistic preferences, has this animal life which
tingles upon every page. We must confess that
there is a certain quality of American idealism
which is covertly suspicious or openly hostile to
the glories of bodily sensation. Emerson's thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
high shoulders peep up reproachfully above the
desk; Lanier is playing his reproachful flute;
Longfellow reads Frémont's Rocky Mountain
experiences while lying abed, and sighs "But, ah,
the discomforts!"; Irving's <i>Astoria</i>, superb as
were the possibilities of its physical background,
tastes like parlor exploration. Even Dana's
<i>Before the Mast</i> and Parkman's <i>Oregon Trail</i>,
transcripts of robust actual experience, and admirable
books, reveal a sort of physical paleness
compared with Turgenieff's <i>Notes of a Sportsman</i>
and Tolstoï's <i>Sketches</i> of Sebastopol and
the Crimea. They are Harvard undergraduate
writing, after all!</p>

<p>These facts illustrate anew that standing
temptation of the critic of American literature to
palliate literary shortcomings by the plea that we
possess certain admirable non-literary qualities.
The dominant idealism of the nation has levied,
or seemed to levy, a certain tax upon our writing.
Some instincts, natural to the full-blooded
utterance of Continental literature, have been
starved or eliminated here. Very well. The characteristic
American retort to this assertion would
be: Better our long record and habit of idealism
than a few masterpieces more or less. As a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
people, we have cheerfully accepted the Puritan
restraint of speech, we have respected the shamefaced
conventions of decent and social utterance.
Like the men and women described in Locker-Lampson's
verses, Americans</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"eat, and drink, and scheme, and plod,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They go to church on Sunday;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many are afraid of God&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more of Mrs. Grundy."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now Mrs. Grundy is assuredly not the most desirable
of literary divinities, but the student of
classical literature can easily think of other divinities,
celebrated in exquisite Greek and Roman
verse, who are distinctly less desirable still.</p>

<p>"Not passion, but sentiment," said Hawthorne,
in a familiar passage of criticism of
his own <i>Twice-Told Tales</i>. How often must the
student of American literature echo that half-melancholy
but just verdict, as he surveys the
transition from the spiritual intensity of a few of
our earlier writers to the sentimental qualities
which have brought popular recognition to the
many. Take the word "soul" itself. Calvinism
shadowed and darkened the meaning, perhaps,
and yet its spiritual passion made the word
"soul" sublime. The reaction against Calvinism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
has made religion more human, natural,
and possibly more Christlike, but "soul" has
lost the thrilling solemnity with which Edwards
pronounced the word. Emerson and Hawthorne,
far as they had escaped from the bonds
of their ancestral religion, still utter the word
"soul" with awe. But in the popular sermon
and hymn and story of our day,&mdash;with
their search after the sympathetic and the sentimental,
after what is called in magazine slang
"heart-interest,"&mdash;the word has lost both its
intellectual distinction and its literary magic.
It will regain neither until it is pronounced
once more with spiritual passion.</p>

<p>But in literature, as in other things, we must
take what we can get. The great mass of our
American writing is sentimental, because it has
been produced by, and for, an excessively sentimental
people. The poems in Stedman's carefully
chosen <i>Anthology</i>, the prose and verse
in the two volume Stedman-Hutchinson collection
of American Literature, the Library of
Southern Literature, and similar sectional anthologies,
the school Readers and Speakers,&mdash;particularly
in the half-century between
1830 and 1880,&mdash;our newspapers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> magazines,&mdash;particularly
the so-called "yellow"
newspapers and the illustrated magazines typified
by <i>Harper's Monthly</i>,&mdash;are all fairly dripping
with sentiment. American oratory is notoriously
the most sentimental oratory of the
civilized world. The <i>Congressional Record</i> still
presents such specimens of sentiment&mdash;delivered
or given leave to be printed, it is true,
for "home consumption" rather than to affect
the course of legislation&mdash;as are inexplicable to
an Englishman or a Frenchman or an Italian.</p>

<p>Immigrants as we all are, and migratory as
we have ever been,&mdash;so much so that one
rarely meets an American who was born in
the house built by his grandfather,&mdash;we cling
with peculiar fondness to the sentiment of
"Home." The best-known American poem,
for decades, was Samuel Woodworth's "Old
Oaken Bucket," the favorite popular song was
Stephen Foster's "My Old Kentucky Home,"
the favorite play was Denman Thompson's
"Old Homestead." Without that appealing
word "mother" the American melodrama would
be robbed of its fifth act. Without pictures of
"the child" the illustrated magazines would go
into bankruptcy. No country has witnessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
such a production of periodicals and books for
boys and girls: France and Germany imitate
in vain <i>The Youth's Companion</i> and <i>St. Nicholas</i>,
as they did the stories of "Oliver Optic" and
<i>Little Women</i> and <i>Little Lord Fauntleroy</i>.</p>

<p>The sentimental attitude towards women and
children, which is one of the most typical aspects
of American idealism, is constantly illustrated
in our short stories. Bret Harte, disciple
of Dickens as he was, and Romantic as was
his fashion of dressing up his miners and gamblers,
was accurately faithful to the American
feeling towards the "kid" and the "woman."
"Tennessee's Partner," "The Luck of Roaring
Camp," "Christmas at Sandy Bar," are obvious
examples. Owen Wister's stories are
equally faithful and admirable in this matter.
The American girl still does astonishing things
in international novels, as she has continued
to do since the eighteen-sixties, but they are
astonishing mainly to the European eye and
against the conventionalized European background.
She does the same things at home,
and neither she nor her mother sees why she
should not, so universal among us is the chivalrous
interpretation of actions and situations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
which amaze the European observer. The popular
American literature which recognizes and
encourages this position of the "young girl"
in our social structure is a literature primarily
of sentiment. The note of passion&mdash;in the European
sense of that word&mdash;jars and shatters
it. The imported "problem-play," written for
an adult public in Paris or London, introduces
social facts and intellectual elements almost
wholly alien to the experience of American
matinée audiences. Disillusioned historians of
our literature have instanced this unsophistication
as a proof of our national inexperience;
yet it is often a sort of radiant and triumphant
unsophistication which does not lose its innocence
in parting with its ignorance.</p>

<p>That sentimental idealization of classes,
whether peasant, bourgeois, or aristocratic,
which has long been a feature of Continental
and English poetry and fiction, is practically
absent from American literature. Whatever the
future may bring, there have hitherto been no
fixed classes in American society. Webster was
guilty of no exaggeration when he declared that
the whole North was made up of laborers,
and Lincoln spoke in the same terms in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
well-known sentences about "hired laborers":
"twenty-five years ago I was a hired laborer."
The relative uniformity of economic and social
conditions, which prevailed until toward the
close of the nineteenth century, made, no
doubt, for the happiness of the greatest number,
but it failed, naturally, to afford that picturesqueness
of class contrast and to stimulate
that sentiment of class distinction, in which
European literature is so rich.</p>

<p>Very interesting, in the light of contemporary
economic conditions, is the effort made by
American poets in the middle of the last century
to glorify labor. They were not so much
idealizing a particular laboring class, as endeavoring,
in Whitman's words, "To teach the
average man the glory of his walk and trade."
Whitman himself sketched the American workman
in almost every attitude which appealed
to his own sense of the picturesque and heroic.
But years before <i>Leaves of Grass</i> was published,
Whittier had celebrated in his <i>Songs of Labor</i>
the glorified images of lumberman and drover,
shoemaker and fisherman. Lucy Larcom and
the authors of <i>The Lowell Offering</i> portrayed
the fine idealism of the young women&mdash;of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
best American stock&mdash;who went enthusiastically
to work in the cotton-mills of Lowell and
Lawrence, or who bound shoes by their own
firesides on the Essex County farms. That glow
of enthusiasm for labor was chiefly moral, but
it was poetical as well. The changes which have
come over the economic and social life of America
are nowhere more sharply indicated than in
that very valley of the Merrimac where, sixty
and seventy years ago, one could "hear America
singing." There are few who are singing to-day
in the cotton-mills; the operators, instead
of girls from the hill-farms, are Greeks, Lithuanians,
Armenians, Italians. Whittier's drovers
have gone forever; the lumbermen and deep-sea
fishermen have grown fewer, and the men
who still swing the axes and haul the frozen
cod-lines are mostly aliens. The pride that once
broke into singing has turned harsh and silent.
"Labor" looms vast upon the future political
and social horizon, but the songs of labor have
lost the lyric note. They have turned into the
dramas and tragedies of labor, as portrayed
with the swift and fierce insistence of the short
story, illustrated by the Kodak. In the great
agricultural sections of the West and South the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
old bucolic sentiment still survives,&mdash;that simple
joy of seeing the "frost upon the pumpkin"
and "the fodder in the stock" which Mr. James
Whitcomb Riley has sung with such charming
fidelity to the type. But even on the Western
farms toil has grown less manual. It is more a
matter of expert handling of machinery. Reaping
and binding may still have their poet, but
he needs to be a Kipling rather than a Burns.</p>

<p>Our literature, then, reveals few traces of
idealization of a class, and but little idealization
of trades or callings. Neither class nor calling
presents anything permanent to the American
imagination, or stands for anything ultimate in
American experience. On the other hand, our
writing is rich in local sentiment and sectional
loyalty. The short story, which has seized so
greedily the more dramatic aspects of American
energy, has been equally true to the quiet
background of rural scenery and familiar ways.
American idealism, as shown in the transformation
of the lesser loyalties of home and countryside
into the larger loyalties of state and
section, and the absorption of these, in turn,
into the emotions of nationalism, is particularly
illustrated in our political verse. A striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
example of the imaginative visualization of the
political units of a state is the spirited roll-call
of the counties in Whittier's "Massachusetts
to Virginia." But the burden of that fine poem,
after all, is the essential unity of Massachusetts
as a sovereign state, girding herself to repel the
attack of another sovereign state, Virginia. Now
the evolution of our political history, both local
and national, has tended steadily, for half a
century, to the obliteration, for purposes of the
imagination, of county lines within state lines.
At the last Republican state convention held
in Massachusetts, there were no county banners
displayed, for the first time in half a century.
Many a city-dweller to-day cannot tell in what
county he is living unless he has happened to
make a transfer of real estate. State lines themselves
are fading away. The federal idea has
triumphed. Doubtless the majority of the fellow
citizens of John Randolph of Roanoke were
all the more proud of him because the poet
could say of him, in writing an admiring and
mournful epitaph:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Beyond Virginia's border line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His patriotism perished."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The great collections of Civil War verse, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
are lying almost unread in the libraries, are store-houses
of this ancient state pride and jealousy,
which was absorbed so fatally into the larger
sectional antagonism. "Maryland, my Maryland"
gave place to "Dixie," just as Whittier's
"Massachusetts to Virginia" was forgotten
when marching men began to sing "John
Brown's Body" and "The Battle Hymn of the
Republic." The literature of sectionalism still
lingers in its more lovable aspect in the verse
and fiction which still celebrates the fairer side
of the civilization of the Old South: its ideals
of chivalry and local loyalty, its gracious women
and gallant men. Our literature needs to cultivate
this provincial affection for the past, as an
offset to the barren uniformity which the federal
scheme allows. But the ultimate imaginative
victory, like the actual political victory of
the Civil War, is with the thought and feeling
of Nationalism. It is foreshadowed in that passionate
lyric cry of Lowell, which sums up so
much and, like all true passion, anticipates so
much:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"O Beautiful! my Country!"</p></blockquote>

<p>The literary record of American idealism
thus illustrates how deeply the conception of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Nationalism has affected the imagination of
our countrymen. The literary record of the
American conception of liberty runs further
back. Some historians have allowed themselves
to think that the American notion of
liberty is essentially declamatory, a sort of futile
echo of Patrick Henry's "Give me Liberty
or give me Death"; and not only declamatory,
but hopelessly theoretical and abstract. They
grant that it was a trumpet-note, no doubt, for
agitators against the Stamp Act, and for pamphleteers
like Thomas Paine; that it may have
been a torch for lighting dark and weary ways
in the Revolutionary War; but they believe it
likewise to be a torch which gleams with the
fire caught from France and which was passed
back to France in turn when her own great
bonfire was ready for lighting. The facts, however,
are inconsistent with this picturesque
theory of contemporary reactionists. It is true
that the word "liberty" has been full of temptation
for generations of American orators, that
it has become an idol of the forum, and often
a source of heat rather than of light. But to
treat American Liberty as if she habitually wore
the red cap is to nourish a Francophobia as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
absurd as Edmund Burke's. The sober truth
is that the American working theory of Liberty
is singularly like St. Paul's. "Ye have been
called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an
occasion to the flesh." A few sentences from
John Winthrop, written in 1645, are significant:
"There is a twofold liberty, natural ... and
civil or federal. The first is common to
man with beasts and other creatures. By this,
man, as he stands in relation to man simply,
hath liberty to do what he lists; it is a liberty
to evil as well as to good. This liberty is incompatible
and inconsistent with authority....
The other kind of liberty I call civil or federal,
it may also be termed moral.... This liberty
is the proper end and object of authority, and
cannot subsist without it; and it is a liberty to
that only which is good, just, and honest. This
liberty you are to stand for, with the hazard
(not only of your goods, but) of your lives, if
need be.... This liberty is maintained and
exercised in a way of subjection to authority;
it is of the same kind of liberty wherewith
Christ hath made us free."</p>

<p>There speaks the governor, the man of affairs,
the typical citizen of the future republic. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
liberty to do as one pleases is a dream of the
Renaissance; but out of dreamland it does not
work. Nobody, even in revolutionary France,
imagines that it will work. Jefferson, who is popularly
supposed to derive his notion of liberty
from French theorists, is to all practical purposes
nearer to John Winthrop than he is to
Rousseau. The splendid phrases of his "Declaration"
are sometimes characterized as abstractions.
They are really generalizations from past
political experience. An arbitrary king, assuming
a liberty to do as he liked, had encroached
upon the long-standing customs and authority
of the colonists. Jefferson, at the bidding of the
Continental Congress, served notice of the royal
trespass, and incidentally produced (as Lincoln
said) a "standard maxim for free society."</p>

<p>It is true, no doubt, that the word "liberty"
became in Jefferson's day, and later, a mere partisan
or national shibboleth, standing for no
reality, degraded to a catchword, a symbol of
antagonism to Great Britain. In the political
debates and the impressive prose and verse of
the anti-slavery struggle, the word became once
more charged with vital meaning; it glowed
under the heat and pressure of an idea. Towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the end of the nineteenth century it went temporarily
out of fashion. The late Colonel Higginson,
an ideal type of what Europeans call an
"1848" man, attended at the close of the century
some sessions of the American Historical
Association. In his own address, at the closing
dinner, he remarked that there was one word for
which he had listened in vain during the reading
of the papers by the younger men. It was
the word "liberty." One of the younger school
retorted promptly that since we had the thing
liberty, we had no need to glorify the word.
But Colonel Higginson, stanch adherent as he
was of the "good old cause," was not convinced.
Like many another lover of American letters,
he thought that William Vaughn Moody's
"Ode in Time of Hesitation" deserved a place
by the side of Lowell's "Commemoration
Ode," and that when the ultimate day of reckoning
comes for the whole muddled Imperialistic
business, the standard of reckoning must
be "liberty" as Winthrop and Jefferson and
Lincoln and Lowell and Vaughn Moody understood
the word.</p>

<p>In the mean time we must confess that the
history of our literature, with a few noble exceptions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
shows a surprising defect in the passion for
freedom. Tennyson's famous lines about "Freedom
broadening slowly down from precedent
to precedent" are perfectly American in their
conservative tone; while it is Englishmen like
Byron and Landor and Shelley and Swinburne
who have written the most magnificent republican
poetry. The "land of the free" turns to
the monarchic mother country, after all, for the
glow and thunder and splendor of the poetry
of freedom. It is one of the most curious phenomena
in the history of literature. Shall we
enter the preoccupation plea once more? Enjoying
the thing liberty, have we been therefore
less concerned with the idea? Or is it simply
another illustration of the defective passion of
American literature?</p>

<p>Yet there is one phase of political loyalty
which has been cherished by the imagination of
Americans, and which has inspired noteworthy
oratory and noble political prose. It is the sentiment
of Union. In one sense, of course, this
dates back to the period of Franklin's <i>bon mot</i>
about our all hanging together, or hanging separately.
It is found in Hamilton's pamphlets,
in Paine's <i>Crisis</i>, in the <i>Federalist</i>, in Washington's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
"Farewell Address." It is peculiarly associated
with the name and fame of Daniel Webster,
and, to a less degree, with the career of
Henry Clay. In the stress of the debate over
slavery, many a Northerner with abolitionist
convictions, like the majority of Southerners
with slave-holding convictions, forgot the splendid
peroration of Webster's "Reply to Hayne"
and were willing to "let the Union go." But
in the four tragic and heroic years that followed
the firing upon the American flag at Fort Sumter
the sentiment of Union was made sacred by
such sacrifices as the patriotic imagination of
a Clay or a Webster had never dreamed. A new
literature resulted. A lofty ideal of indissoluble
Union was preached in pulpits, pleaded
for in editorials, sung in lyrics, and woven
into the web of fiction. Edward Everett Hale's
<i>Man Without a Country</i> became one of the
most poignantly moving of American stories.
In Walt Whitman's <i>Drum-Taps</i> and his later
poems, the "Union of these States" became
transfigured with mystical significance: no longer
a mere political compact, dissoluble at will,
but a spiritual entity, a new incarnation of the
soul of man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>We must deal later with that American instinct
of fellowship which Whitman believed to
have been finally cemented by the Civil War,
and which has such import for the future of our
democracy. There are likewise communal loyalties,
glowing with the new idealism which has
come with the twentieth century: ethical, municipal,
industrial, and artistic movements which
are full of promise for the higher life of the country,
but which have not yet had time to express
themselves adequately in literature. There are
stirrings of racial loyalty among this and that
element of our composite population,&mdash;as for
instance among the gifted younger generation
of American Jews,&mdash;a racial loyalty not antagonistic
to the American current of ideas, but
rather in full unison with it. Internationalism
itself furnishes motives for the activity of the
noblest imaginations, and the true literature of
internationalism has hardly yet begun. It is in
the play and counterplay of these new forces
that the American literature of the twentieth
century must measure itself. Communal feelings
novel to Americans bred under the accepted
individualism will doubtless assert themselves
in our prose and verse. But it is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
remembered that the best writing thus far produced
on American soil has been a result of the
old conditions: of the old "Reverences"; of the
pioneer training of mind and body; of the slow
tempering of the American spirit into an obstinate
idealism. We do not know what course the
ship may take in the future, but</p>

Romance and Reaction</h2>


<p>The characteristic attitude of the American
mind, as we have seen, is one of idealism. We
may now venture to draw a smaller circle within
that larger circle of idealistic impulses, and
to label the smaller circle "romance." Here,
too, as with the word "idealism," although we
are to make abundant use of literary illustrations
of national tendencies, we have no need of a severely
technical definition of terms. When we
say, "Tom is an idealist" and "Lorenzo is a
romantic fellow," we convey at least one tolerably
clear distinction between Tom and Lorenzo.
The idealist has a certain characteristic
habit of mind or inclination of spirit. When
confronted by experience, he reacts in a certain
way. In his individual and social impulses, in
the travail of his soul, or in his commerce with
his neighbors and the world, he behaves in a
more or less well-defined fashion. The romanticist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
when confronted by the same objects and
experiences, exhibits another type of behavior.
Lorenzo, though he be Tom's brother, is a
different fellow; he is&mdash;in the opinion of his
friends, at least&mdash;a rather more peculiar person,
a creature of more varying moods, of heightened
feelings, of stranger ways. Like Tom, he
is a person of sentiment, but his sentiment attaches
itself, not so much to everyday aspects
of experience, as to that which is unusual or terrifying,
lovely or far away; he possesses, or would
like to possess, bodily or spiritual daring. He
has the adventurous heart. He is of those who
love to go down to the sea in ships and do business
in great waters. Lorenzo the romanticist
is made of no finer clay than Tom the idealist,
but his nerves are differently tuned. Your deep-sea
fisherman, after all, is only a fisherman at bottom.
That is to say, he too is an idealist, but
he wants to catch different species of fish from
those which drop into the basket of the landsman.
Precisely what he covets, perhaps he does
not know. I was once foolish enough to ask an
old Alsatian soldier who was patiently holding
his rod over a most unpromising canal near
Strassburg, what kind of fish he was fishing for.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
"All kinds," was his rebuking answer, and I
took off my hat to the veteran romanticist.</p>

<p>The words "romance" and "romanticism"
have been repeated to the ears of our generation
with wearisome iteration. Not the least of
the good luck of Wordsworth and Coleridge lay
in the fact that they scarcely knew that they
were "romanticists." Middle-aged readers of
the present day may congratulate themselves
that in their youth they read Wordsworth and
Coleridge simply because it was Wordsworth
and Coleridge and not documents illustrating
the history of the romantic movement. But the
rising generation is sophisticated. For better or
worse it has been taught to distinguish between
the word "romance" on the one side, and the
word "romanticism" on the other. "Romantic"
is a useful but overworked adjective which
attaches itself indiscriminately to both "romance"
and "romanticism." Professor Vaughan,
for example, and a hundred other writers, have
pointed out that in the narrower and more usual
sense, the words "romance" and "romanticism"
point to a love of vivid coloring and strongly
marked contrasts; to a craving for the unfamiliar,
the marvellous, and the supernatural. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
wider and less definite sense, they signify a revolt
from the purely intellectual view of man's nature;
a recognition of the instincts and the passions,
a vague intimation of sympathy between
man and the world around him,&mdash;in one word,
the sense of mystery. The narrower and the
broader meanings pass into one another by imperceptible
shades. They are affected by the
well-known historic conditions for romantic
feeling in the different European countries. The
common factor, of course, is the man with the
romantic world set in his heart. It is Gautier
with his love of color, Victor Hugo enraptured
with the sound of words, Heine with his self-destroying
romantic irony, Novalis with his
blue flower, and Maeterlinck with his <i>Blue Bird</i>.</p>

<p>But these romantic men of letters, writing
in epochs of romanticism, are by no means
the only children of romance. Sir Humphrey
Gilbert and Sir Walter Raleigh were as truly
followers of "the gleam" as were Spenser or
Marlowe. The spirit of romance is found wherever
and whenever men say to themselves, as
Don Quixote's niece said of her uncle, that
"they wish better bread than is made of wheat,"
or when they look within their own hearts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
assert, as the poet Young said in 1759, long
before the English romantic movement had
begun, "there is more in the spirit of man than
mere prose-reason can fathom."</p>

<p>We are familiar, perhaps too remorsefully
familiar, with the fact that romance is likely to
run a certain course in the individual and then
to disappear. Looking back upon it afterward,
it resembles the upward and downward zigzag
of a fever chart. It has in fact often been described
as a measles, a disease of which no one
can be particularly proud, although he may
have no reason to blush for it. Southey said
that he was no more ashamed of having been
a republican than of having been a boy. Well,
people catch Byronism, and get over it, much
as Southey got over his republicanism. In fact
Byron himself lived long enough&mdash;though
he died at thirty-six&mdash;to outgrow his purely
"Byronic" phase, and to smile at it as knowingly
as we do. Coleridge's blossoming period
as a romantic poet was tragically brief. Keats
and Shelley had the good fortune to die in the
fulness of their romantic glory. They did not
outlive their own poetic sense of the wonder
and mystery of the world. Yet many an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
poet like Tennyson and Browning has preserved
his romance to the end. Tennyson dies
at eighty-three with the full moonlight streaming
through the oriel window upon his bed,
and with his fingers clasping Shakespeare's
<i>Cymbeline</i>.</p>

<p>With most of us commonplace persons, however,
a reaction from the romantic is almost
inevitable. The romantic temperament cannot
long keep the pitch. Poe could indeed do it,
although he hovered at times near the border
of insanity. Hawthorne went for relief to his
profane sea-captains and the carnal-minded superannuated
employees of the Salem Custom
House. "The weary weight of all this unintelligible
world" presses too hard on most of
those who stop to think about it. The simplest
way of relief is to shrug one's shoulders
and let the weight go. That is to say, we cease
being poets, we are no longer the children of
romance, although we may remain idealists.
Perhaps it is external events that change, rather
than we ourselves. The restoration of the Bourbons,
the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, make
and unmake romantics. Often society catches
up with the romanticist; he is no longer a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
soldier of revolt; he has become a "respectable."
Or, while remaining a poet, he shifts his attention
to some more familiar segment of the idealistic
circle. He sings about his wife instead of
the wife of somebody else. Like Wordsworth,
he takes for his theme a Mary Hutchinson instead
of the unknown and hauntingly alluring
figure of Lucy. To put it differently, the high
light, the mysterious color of dawn or sunset
disappears from his picture of human life. Or,
the high light may be diffused in a more tranquil
radiance over the whole surface of experience.
Such an artist may remain a true painter
or poet, but he is not a romantic poet or painter
any longer. He has, like the aging Emerson,
taken in sail; the god Terminus has said to him,
"no more."</p>

<p>One must of course admit that the typical
romanticist has often been characterized by certain
intellectual and moral weaknesses. But the
great romance men, like Edmund Spenser, for
example, may not possess these weaknesses at
all. Robert Louis Stevenson was passionately
in love with the romantic in life and with romanticism
in literature; but it did not make him
eccentric, weak, or empty. His instinct for enduring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
romance was so admirably fine that it
brought strength to the sinews of his mind,
light and air and fire to his soul. Among the
writers of our own day, it is Mr. Kipling who
has written some of the keenest satire upon
romantic foibles, while never ceasing to salute
his real mistress, the true romance.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who wast, or yet the Lights were set,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A whisper in the void,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shalt be sung through planets young<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When this is clean destroyed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What are the causes of American romance,
the circumstances and qualities that have produced
the romantic element in American life
and character? Precisely as with the individual
artist or man of letters, we touch first of all
upon certain temperamental inclinations. It is
a question again of the national mind, of the
differentiation of the race under new climatic
and physical conditions. We have to reckon
with the headiness and excitability of youth.
It was young men who emigrated hither, just as
in the eighteen-sixties it was young men who
filled the Northern and the Southern armies.
The first generations of American immigration
were made up chiefly of vigorous, imaginative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
and daring youth. The incapables came later.
It is, I think, safe to assert that the colonists
of English stock, even as late as 1790,&mdash;when
more than ninety per cent of the population
of America had in their veins the blood of the
British Isles,&mdash;were more responsive to romantic
impulses than their English cousins.
For that matter, an Irishman or a Welshman is
more romantic than an Englishman to-day.</p>

<p>From the very beginning of the American
settlements, likewise, there were evidences of the
weaker, the over-excitable side of the romantic
temper. There were volatile men like Morton
of Merrymount; there were queer women like
Anne Hutchinson, admirable woman as she
was; among the wives of the colonists there
were plenty of Emily Dickinsons in the germ.
Among the men, there were schemes that came
to nothing. There were prototypes of Colonel
Sellers; a temperamental tendency toward that
recklessness and extravagance which later historical
conditions stimulated and confirmed.
The more completely one studies the history
of our forefathers on American soil, the more
deeply does one become conscious of the prevailing
atmosphere of emotionalism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>Furthermore, as one examines the historic
conditions under which the spirit of American
romance has been preserved and heightened
from time to time, one becomes aware that although
ours is rather a romance of wonder than
of beauty, the spirit of beauty is also to be found.
The first fervors of the romance of discovery
were childlike in their eagerness. Hakluyt's
<i>Voyages</i>, John Smith's <i>True Relation of Virginia</i>,
Thomas Morton's <i>New England's Canaan</i>, all
appeal to the sense of the marvellous.</p>

<p>Listen to Morton's description of Cape Ann.
I can never read it without thinking of Botticelli's
picture of Spring, so naïvely does this
picturesque rascal suffuse his landscape with the
feeling for beauty:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"In the Moneth of June, Anno Salutis 1622,
it was my chaunce to arrive in the parts of New
England with 30. Servants, and provision of
all sorts fit for a plantation: and whiles our
howses were building, I did indeavour to take
a survey of the Country: The more I looked,
the more I liked it. And when I had more seriously
considered of the bewty of the place, with
all her faire indowments, I did not thinke that
in all the knowne world it could be paralel'd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
for so many goodly groves of trees, dainty fine
round rising hillucks, delicate faire large plaines,
sweete cristall fountaines, and cleare running
streames that twine in fine meanders through
the meads, making so sweete a murmering noise
to heare as would even lull the sences with delight
a sleepe, so pleasantly doe they glide upon
the pebble stones, jetting most jocundly where
they doe meete and hand in hand runne downe
to Neptunes Court, to pay the yearely tribute
which they owe to him as soveraigne Lord of all
the springs. Contained within the volume of
the Land, Fowles in abundance, Fish in multitude;
and discovered, besides, Millions of
Turtledoves on the greene boughes, which sate
pecking of the full ripe pleasant grapes that were
supported by the lusty trees, whose fruitful
loade did cause the armes to bend: while here
and there dispersed, you might see Lillies and
the Daphnean-tree: which made the Land to
mee seeme paradice: for in mine eie t'was Natures
Masterpeece; Her cheifest Magazine of
all where lives her store: if this Land be not
rich, then is the whole world poore."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the Morton who, a few years later,
settled at Merrymount. Let me condense the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
story of his settlement, from the narrative of
the stout-hearted Governor William Bradford's
<i>History of Plymouth Plantation</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<blockquote><p>"And Morton became lord of misrule, and
maintained (as it were) a schoole of Athisme.
And after they had gott some good into their
hands, and gott much by trading with the Indeans,
they spent it as vainly, in quaffing &amp; drinking
both wine &amp; strong waters in great exsess,
and, as some reported 10£. worth in a morning.
They allso set up a May-pole, drinking and
dancing aboute it many days togeather, inviting
the Indean women, for their consorts, dancing
and frisking togither, (like so many fairies, or
furies rather,) and worse practises. As if they
had anew revived &amp; celebrated the feasts of the
Roman Goddes Flora, or the beasly practieses
of the madd Bacchinalians. Morton likewise
(to shew his poetrie) composed sundry rimes
&amp; verses, some tending to lasciviousnes, and
others to the detraction &amp; scandall of some persons,
which he affixed to this idle or idoll May-polle.
They chainged allso the name of their
place, and in stead of calling it Mounte Wollaston,
they call it Merie-mounte, as if this
joylity would have lasted ever."</p></blockquote>

<p>But it did not last long. Bradford and other
leaders of the plantations "agreed by mutual
consent" to "suppress Morton and his consorts."
"In a friendly and neighborly way"
they admonished him. "Insolently he persisted."
"Upon which they saw there was no
way but to take him by force." "So they mutually
resolved to proceed," and sent Captain
Standish to summon him to yield. But, says
Bradford, Morton and some of his crew came
out, not to yield, but to shoot; all of them
rather drunk; Morton himself, with a carbine
almost half filled with powder and shot, had
thought to have shot Captain Standish, "<i>but he
stepped to him and put by his piece and took him</i>."</p>

<p>It is not too fanciful to say that with those
stern words of Governor Bradford the English
Renaissance came to an end. The dream of a
lawless liberty which has been dreamed and
dreamed out so many times in the history of
the world was over, for many a day. It was
only a hundred years earlier that Rabelais had
written over the doors of his ideal abbey, the
motto "Do what thou wilt." It is true that
Rabelais proposed to admit to his Abbey of
Thélème only such men and women as were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
virtuously inclined. We do not know how
many persons would have been able and willing
to go into residence there. At any rate, two
hundred years went by in New England after
the fall of Morton before any notable spirit
dared to cherish once more the old Renaissance
ideal. At last, in Emerson's doctrine that all
things are lawful because Nature is good and
human nature is divine, we have a curious parallel
to the doctrine of Rabelais. It was the
old romance of human will under a new form
and voiced in new accents. Yet in due time the
hard facts of human nature reasserted themselves
and put this romantic transcendentalism
by, even as the implacable Myles Standish put
by that heavily loaded fowling-piece of the
drunken Morton.</p>

<p>But men believed in miracles in the first century
of colonization, and they will continue at
intervals to believe in them until human nature
is no more. The marvellous happenings recorded
in Cotton Mather's <i>Magnalia</i> no longer
excite us to any "suspension of disbelief."
We doubt the story of Pocahontas. The fresh
romantic enthusiasm of a settler like Crèvec&#339;ur
seems curiously juvenile to-day, as does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the romantic curiosity of Chateaubriand concerning
the Mississippi and the Choctaws, or
the zeal of Wordsworth and Coleridge over
their dream of a "panti-Socratic" community
in the unknown valley of the musically-sounding
Susquehanna. Inexperience is a perpetual
feeder of the springs of romance. John Wesley,
it will be remembered, went out to the colony
of Georgia full of enthusiasm for converting
the Indians; but as he naïvely remarks in his
<i>Journal</i>, he "neither found or heard of any Indians
on the continent of America, who had the
least desire of being instructed." The sense of
fact, in other words, supervenes, and the glory
disappears from the face of romance. The humor
of Mark Twain's <i>Innocents Abroad</i> turns
largely upon this sense of remorseless fact confronting
romantic inexperience.</p>

<p>American history, however, has been marked
by certain great romantic passions that seem
endowed with indestructible vitality. The romance
of discovery, the fascination of the forest
and sea, the sense of danger and mystery
once aroused by the very word "redskin," have
all moulded and will continue to mould the
national imagination. How completely the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
romance of discovery may be fused with the
glow of humanitarian and religious enthusiasm
has been shown once for all in the brilliant
pages of Parkman's story of the Jesuit missions
in Canada. Pictorial romance can scarcely go
further than this. In the crisis of Chateaubriand's
picturesque and passionate tale of the
American wilderness, no one can escape the
thrilling, haunting sound of the bell from the
Jesuit chapel, as it tolls in the night and storm
that were fatal to the happiness of Atala. One
scarcely need say that the romance of missions
has never faded from the American mind. I
have known a sober New England deacon aged
eighty-five, who disliked to die because he
thought he should miss the monthly excitement
of reading the <i>Missionary Herald</i>. The
deacon's eyes, like the eyes of many an old sea-captain
in Salem or Newburyport, were literally
upon the ends of the earth. No one can
reckon how many starved souls, deprived of
normal outlet for human feeling, have found
in this passionate curiosity and concern for the
souls of black and yellow men and women in
the antipodes, a constant source of beneficent
excitement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor is there any diminution of interest in the
mere romance of adventure, in the stories of
hunter and trapper, the journals of Lewis and
Clarke, the narratives of Boone and Crockett.
In writing his superb romances of the Northern
Lakes, the prairie and the sea, Fenimore
Cooper had merely to bring to an artistic focus
sentiments that lay deep in the souls of the
great mass of his American readers. Students
of our social life have pointed out again and
again how deeply our national temperament
has been affected by the existence, during
nearly three hundred years, of an alien aboriginal
race forever lurking upon the borders of
our civilization. "Playing Indian" has been
immensely significant, not merely in stimulating
the outdoor activity of generations of
American boys, but in teaching them the perennial
importance of certain pioneer qualities
of observation, resourcefulness, courage, and
endurance which date from the time when the
Indians were a daily and nightly menace. Even
when the Indian has been succeeded by the
cowboy, the spirit of romance still lingers,&mdash;as
any collection of cowboy ballads will abundantly
prove. And when the cowboys pass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
and the real-estate dealers take possession of
the field, one is tempted to say that romance
flourishes more than ever.</p>

<p>In short, things are what we make them at
the moment, what we believe them to be. In
my grandfather's youth the West was in the
neighborhood of Port Byron, New York, and
when he journeyed thither from Massachusetts
in the eighteen-twenties, the glory of adventure
enfolded him as completely as the boys
of the preceding generation had been glorified
in the War of the Revolution, or the boys of
the next generation when they went gold-seeking
in California in 1849. The West, in short,
means simply the retreating horizon, the beckoning
finger of opportunity. Like Boston, it
has been not a place, but a "state of mind."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We must go, go, go away from here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the other side the world we're overdue."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That is the song which sings itself forever
in the heart of youth. Champlain and Cartier
heard it in the sixteenth century, Bradford no
less than Morton in the seventeenth. Some
Eldorado has always been calling to the more
adventurous spirits upon American soil. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
passion of the forty-niner neither began nor
ended with the discovery of gold in California.
It is within us. It transmutes the harsh or
drab-colored everyday routine into tissue of
fairyland. It makes our "winning of the
West" a magnificent national epic. It changes
to-day the black belt of Texas, or the wheat-fields
of Dakota, into pots of gold that lie at
the end of rainbows, only that the pot of gold
is actually there. The human hunger of it all,
the gorgeous dream-like quality of it all, the
boundlessness of the vast American spaces, the
sense of forest and prairie and sky, are all inexplicably
blended with our notion of the ideal
America. Henry James once tried to explain
the difference between Turgenieff and a typical
French novelist by saying that the back door
of the Russian's imagination was always open
upon the endless Russian steppe. No one can
understand the spirit of American romance if
he is not conscious of this ever-present hinterland
in which our spirits have, from the beginning,
taken refuge and found solace.</p>

<p>We have already noticed, in the chapter on
idealism, how swiftly the American imagination
modifies the prosaic facts of everyday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
experience. The idealistic glamour which falls
upon the day's work changes easily, in the
more emotional temperaments, and at times,
indeed, in all of us, into the fervor of true romance.
Then, the prosaic buying and selling
becomes the "game." A combination of buyers
and sellers becomes the "system." The
place where these buyers and sellers most do
congregate and concentrate becomes "Wall
Street"&mdash;a sort of anthropomorphic monster
which seems to buy and sell the bodies and souls
of men. Seen half a continent away, through the
mists of ignorance and prejudice and partisan
passion, "Wall Street" has loomed like some
vast Gibraltar. To the broker's clerk who earns
his weekly salary in that street, the Nebraska
notion of "Wall Street" is too grotesque for
discussion.</p>

<p>How easily every phase of American business
life may take on the hues of romance is
illustrated by the history of our railroads. No
wonder that Bret Harte wrote a poem about
the meeting of the eastward and westward facing
engines when the two sections of the Union
Pacific Railroad at last drew near each other
on the interminable plains and the two engines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
could talk. Of course what they said was
poetry. There was a time when even the Erie
Canal was poetic. The Panama Canal to-day, in
the eyes of most Americans, is something other
than a mere feat of engineering. We are doing
more than making "the dirt fly." The canal
represents victory over hostile forces, conquest
of unwilling Nature, achievement of what had
long been deemed impossible, the making not
of a ditch, but of History.</p>

<p>So with all that American zest for camping,
fishing, sailing, racing, which lies deep in the
Anglo-Saxon, and which succeeds to the more
primitive era of actual struggle against savage
beasts or treacherous men or mysterious forests.
It is at once an outlet and a nursery for
romantic emotion. The out-of-doors movement
which began with Thoreau's hut on Walden
Pond, and which has gone on broadening
and deepening to this hour, implies far more
than mere variation from routine. It furnishes,
indeed, a healthful escape from the terrific pressure
of modern social and commercial exigencies.
Yet its more important function is to provide
for grown-ups a chance to "play Indian"
too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>But outdoors and indoors, after all, lie in the
heart and mind, rather than in the realm of
actual experience. The romantic imagination
insists upon taking its holiday, whether the
man who possesses it gets his holiday or not.
I have never known a more truly romantic
figure than a certain tin-pedler in Connecticut
who, in response to the question, "Do you do
a good business?" made this perfectly Stevensonian
reply: "Well, I make a living selling
crockery and tinware, but my <i>business</i> is the
propagation of truth."</p>

<p>This wandering idealist may serve to remind
us again of the difference between romance and
romanticism. The true romance is of the spirit.
Romanticism shifts and changes with external
fortunes, with altering emotions, with the alternate
play of light and shade over the vast landscape
of human experience. The typical romanticist,
as we have seen, is a man of moods.
It is only a Poe who can keep the pitch through
the whole concert of experience. But the deeper
romance of the spirit is oblivious of these changes
of external fortune, this rising or falling of
the emotional temperature. The moral life of
America furnishes striking illustrations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
steadfastness with which certain moral causes
have been kept, as it were, in the focus of intense
feeling. Poetry, undefeated and unwavering
poetry, has transfigured such practical
propaganda as the abolition of slavery, the
emancipation of woman, the fight against the
liquor traffic, the emancipation of the individual
from the clutches of economic and commercial
despotism. Men like Colonel Thomas Wentworth
Higginson, women like Julia Ward
Howe, fought for these causes throughout their
lives. Colonel Higginson's attitude towards
women was not merely chivalric (for one may
be chivalrous without any marked predisposition
to romance), but nobly romantic also.
James Russell Lowell, poet as he was, outlived
that particular phase of romantic moral reform
which he had been taught by Maria White. But
in other men and women bred in that old New
England of the eighteen-forties, the moral fervor
knew no restraint. Garrison, although in
many respects a most unromantic personality,
was engaged in a task which gave him all the
inspiration of romance. A romantic "atmosphere,"
fully as highly colored as any of the
romantic atmospheres that we are accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
to mark in literature, surrounded as with a
luminous mist the figures of the New England
transcendentalists. They, too, as Heine said of
himself, were soldiers. They felt themselves
enlisted for a long but ultimately victorious
campaign. They were willing to pardon, in
their comrades and in themselves, those imaginative
excesses which resemble the physical
excesses of a soldier's camp. Transcendentalism
was thus a militant philosophy and religion,
with both a destructively critical and a positively
constructive creed. Channing, Parker,
Alcott, Margaret Fuller, were warrior-priests,
poets and prophets of a gallant campaign
against inherited darkness and bigotry, and for
the light.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of that score of years in
New England was now superheated, now
rarefied, thin, and cold; but it was never
quite the normal atmosphere of every day. On
the purely literary side, it is needless to say,
these men and women sought inspiration in
Coleridge and Carlyle and other English and
German romanticists. In fact, the most enduring
literature of New England between 1830
and 1865 was distinctly a romantic literature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
It was rooted, however, not so much in those
swift changes of historic condition, those startling
liberations of the human spirit which gave
inspiration to the romanticism of the Continent,
as it was in the deep and vital fervor with
which these New Englanders envisaged the
problems of the moral life.</p>

<p>Other illustrations of the American capacity
for romance lie equally close at hand. Take, for
instance, the stout volume in which Mr. Burton
Stevenson has collected the <i>Poems of American
History</i>. Here are nearly seven hundred
pages of closely printed patriotic verse. While
Stedman's <i>Anthology</i> reveals no doubt national
aspirations and national sentiment, as well as
the emotional fervor of individuals, Mr. Stevenson's
collection has the advantage of focussing
this national feeling upon specific events.
Stedman's <i>Anthology</i> is an enduring document
of American idealism, touching in the sincerity
of its poetic moods, pathetic in its long lists
of men and women who are known by one
poem only, or who have never, for one reason
or another, fulfilled their poetic promise. The
thousand poems which it contains are more
striking, in fact, for their promise than for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
performance. They are intimations of what
American men and women would have liked
to do or to be. In this sense, it is a precious
volume, but it is certainly not commensurate,
either in passion or in artistic perfection, with
the forces of that American life which it tries
to interpret. Indeed, Mr. Stedman, after finishing
his task of compilation, remarked to
more than one of his friends that what this
country needed was some "adult male verse."</p>

<p>The <i>Poems of American History</i> collected by
Mr. Stevenson are at least vigorous and concrete.
One aspect of our history which especially
lends itself to Mr. Stevenson's purpose
is the romance which attaches itself to war. It
is scarcely necessary to say nowadays that all
wars, even the noblest, have had their sordid,
grimy, selfish, bestial aspect; and that the intelligence
and conscience of our modern world
are more and more engaged in the task of making
future wars impossible. But the slightest
acquaintance with American history reveals
the immense reservoir of romantic emotion
which has been drawn upon in our national
struggles. War, of course, is an immemorial
source of romantic feeling. William James's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
notable essay on "A Moral Substitute for
War" endeavored to prove that our modern
economic and social life, if properly organized,
would give abundant outlet and satisfaction to
those romantic impulses which formerly found
their sole gratification in battle. Many of us
believe that he was right; but for the moment
we must look backward and not forward. We
must remember the stern if rude poetry inspired
by our Revolutionary struggle, the romantic
halo that falls upon the youthful figure
of Nathan Hale, the baleful light that touches
the pale face of Benedict Arnold, the romance
of the Bennington fight to the followers of
Stark and Ethan Allen, the serene voice of
the "little captain," John Paul Jones:&mdash;"We
have not struck, we have just begun our part
of the fighting." The colors of romance still
drape the Chesapeake and the Shannon, Tecumseh
and Tippecanoe. The hunters of Kentucky,
the explorers of the Yellowstone and the
Columbia, the emigrants who left their bones
along the old Santa Fé Trail, are our Homeric
men.</p>

<p>The Mexican War affords pertinent illustration,
not only of romance, but of reaction. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
earlier phases of the Texan struggle for independence
have much of the daring, the splendid
rashness, the glorious and tragic catastrophes
of the great romantic adventures of the Old
World. It is not the Texans only who still
"remember the Alamo," but when those brilliant
and dramatic adventures of border warfare
became drawn into the larger struggle for
the extension of slavery, the poetic reaction began.
The physical and moral pretence of warfare,
the cheap splendors of epaulets and feathers,
shrivelled at the single touch of the satire
of the <i>Biglow Papers</i>. Lowell, writing at that
moment with the instinct and fervor of a prophet,
brought the whole vainglorious business
back to the simple issue of right and wrong:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Taint your eppyletts an' feathers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Make the thing a grain more right;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Taint afollerin' your bell-wethers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will excuse ye in His sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ef you take a sword an' dror it,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">An' go stick a feller thru,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guv'ment aint to answer for it,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">God'll send the bill to you."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But far more interesting is the revelation of
the American capacity for romance which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
made possible by the war between the States.
Stevenson's <i>Poems of American History</i> and
Stedman's <i>Anthology</i> give abundant illustration
of almost every aspect of that epical struggle.
The South was in a romantic mood from the
very beginning. The North drifted into it after
Sumter. I have already said that no one can
examine a collection of Civil War verse without
being profoundly moved by its evidence
of American idealism. In specific phases of the
struggle, in connection with certain battle-fields
and certain leaders of both North and South,
this idealism is heightened into pure romance,
so that even our novelists feel that they can
give no adequate picture of the war without
using the colors of poetry. Most critics, no
doubt, agree in feeling that we are still too
near to that epoch-making crisis of our national
existence to do it any justice in the terms of
literature. Perhaps we must wait for the perfected
romance of the years 1861-65, until the
men and the events of that struggle are as
remote as the heroes of Greece and Troy. Certainly
no one can pass a final judgment upon
the verse occasioned by recent struggles in
arms. Any one who has studied the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
poetry inspired by the South-African War will
be painfully conscious of the emotional and
moral complexity of all such issues, of the bitter
injustice which poets, as well as other men,
render to one another, of the impossibility of
transmuting into the pure gold of romance the
emotions originating in the stock market, in
race-hatred, and in national vainglory.</p>

<p>We have lingered too long, perhaps, over
these various evidences of the romantic temper
of America. We must now glance at the
forces of reaction, the recoil to fact. What
is it which contradicts, inhibits, or negatives
the romantic tendency? Among other forces,
there is certainly humor. Humor and romance
often go hand in hand, but humor is commonly
fatal to romanticism. There is satire, which rebukes
both romanticism and romance, which
exposes the fallacies of the one, and punctures
the exuberance of the other. More effective,
perhaps, than either humor or satire as an antiseptic
against romance, is the overmastering
sense of fact. This is what Emerson called the
instinct for the milk in the pan, an instinct
which Emerson himself possessed extraordinarily
on his purely Yankee side, and which a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
pioneer country is forced continually to develop
and to recognize. Camping, for instance, develops
both the romantic sense and the fact
sense. Supper must be cooked, even at Walden
Pond. There must be hewers of wood and
drawers of water, and the dishes ought to be
washed.</p>

<p>On a higher plane, also, than this mere
sense of physical necessity, there are forces
limiting the influence of romance. Schiller put
it all into one famous line:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Und was uns alle bändigt, das Gemeine."</p></blockquote>

<p>Or listen to Keats:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"'T is best to remain aloof from people, and
like their good parts, without being eternally
troubled with the dull process of their everyday
lives.... All I can say is that standing at
Charing Cross, and looking East, West, North
and South, I can see nothing but dullness."</p></blockquote>

<p>And Henry James, describing New York in
his book, <i>The American Scene</i>, speaks of "the
overwhelming preponderance of the unmitigated
'business-man' face ... the consummate
monotonous commonness of the pushing
male crowd, moving in its dense mass&mdash;with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the confusion carried to chaos for any intelligence,
any perception; a welter of objects and
sounds in which relief, detachment, dignity,
meaning, perished utterly and lost all rights
... the universal <i>will to move</i>&mdash;to move,
move, move, as an end in itself, an appetite at
any price."</p>

<p>One need not be a poet like Keats or an inveterate
psychologist like Henry James, in order
to become aware how the commonplaceness
of the world rests like a fog upon the mind and
heart. No one goes to his day's work and
comes home again without a consciousness of
contact with an unspiritual atmosphere, or incompletely
spiritualized forces, not merely with
indifference, to what Emerson would term
"the over-soul," but with a lack of any faith
in the things which are unseen. Take those
very forces which have limited the influence of
Emerson throughout the United States; they
illustrate the universal forces which clip the
wings of romance. The obstacles in the path
of Emerson's influence are not merely the religious
and denominational differences which
Dr. George A. Gordon portrayed in a notable
article at the time of the Emerson Centenary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
The real obstacles are more serious. It is true
that Dr. Park of Andover, Dr. Bushnell of
Hartford, and Dr. Hodge of Princeton, could
say in Emerson's lifetime: "We know a better,
a more Scriptural and certificated road toward
the very things which Emerson is seeking
for. We do not grant that we are less idealistic
than he. We think him a dangerous guide, following
wandering fires. It is better to journey
safely with us."</p>

<p>But I have known at least two livery-stable
keepers and many college professors who would
unite in saying: "Hodge and Park and Bushnell
and Emerson are all following after something
that does not exist. One is not much
more mistaken than the others. We can get
along perfectly well in our business without any
of those ideas at all. Let us stick to the milk
in the pan, the horse in the stall, the documents
which you will find in the library."</p>

<p>There exists, in other words, in all classes
of American society to-day, just as there existed
during the Revolution, during the transcendental
movement, or the Civil War, an immense
mass of unspiritualized, unvitalized American
manhood and womanhood. No literature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
comes from it and no religion, though there is
much human kindness, much material progress,
and some indestructible residuum of that idealism
which lifts man above the brute.</p>

<p>Yet the curious and the endlessly fascinating
thing about these forces of reaction is that they
themselves shift and change. We have seen
that external romance depending upon strangeness
of scene, novelty of adventure, rich atmospheric
distance of space or time, disappears
with the changes of civilization. The farm expands
over the wolf's den, the Indian becomes
a blacksmith, but do the gross and material
instincts ultimately triumph? He would be a
hardy prophet who should venture to assert it.
We must reckon always with the swing of the
human pendulum, with the reaction against reaction.
Here, for example, during the last decade,
has been book after book written about
the reaction against democracy. All over the
world, it is asserted, there are unmistakable signs
that democracy will not practically work in the
face of the modern tasks to which the world
has set itself. One reads these books, one persuades
himself that the hour for democracy is
passing, and then one goes out on the street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
and buys a morning newspaper and discovers
that democracy has scored again. So is it with
the experience of the individual. You may
fancy that the romance of the seas passes, for
you, with the passing of the square-sailed ship.
If Mr. Kipling's poetry cannot rouse you from
that mood of reaction, walk down to the end
of the pier to-morrow and watch the ocean
liner come up the harbor. If there is no romance
there, you do not know romance when
you see it!</p>

<p>Take the case of the farmer; his prosaic life
is the butt of the newspaper paragraphers from
one end of the country to the other. But does
romance disappear from the farm with machinery
and scientific agriculture? There are farmers
who follow Luther Burbank's experiments
with plants, with all the fascination
which used to attach to alchemy and astrology.
The farmer has no longer Indians to fight or
a wilderness to subdue, but the soils of his
farm are analyzed at his state university by
men who live in the daily atmosphere of the
romance of science, and who say, as a professor
in the University of Chicago said once,
that "a flower is so wonderful that if you knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
what was going on within its cell-structure,
you would be afraid to stay alone with it in
the dark."</p>

<p>The reaction from romance, therefore, real
as it is, and dead weight as it lies upon the
soul of the nation, often breeds the very forces
which destroy it. In other words, the reaction
against one type of romance produces inevitably
another type of romance, other aspects of
wonder, terror, and beauty. Following the romance
of adventure comes, after never so deep
a trough in the sea, the romance of science, like
the crest of another wave; and then comes what
we call, for lack of a better word, the psychological
romance, the old mystery and strangeness
of the human soul, Æschylus and Job, as
Victor Hugo says, in the poor crawfish gatherer
on the rocks of Brittany.</p>

<p>We must remember that we are endeavoring
to measure great spaces and to take account
of the "amplitude of time." The individual
"fact-man," as Coleridge called him, remains
perhaps a fact-man to the end, just as the
dreamer may remain a dreamer. But no single
generation is compounded all of fact or all of
dream. Longfellow felt, no doubt, that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
was an ideal United States, which Dickens did
not discover during that first visit of 1842; he
would have set the Cambridge which he knew
over against the Cincinnati viewed by Mrs.
Trollope; he would have asserted that the
homes characterized by refinement, by cultivation,
by pure and simple sentiment, made up
the true America. But even among Longfellow's
own contemporaries there was Whitman,
who felt that the true America was something
very different from that exquisitely tempered
ideal of Longfellow. There was Thoreau, who,
over in Concord, had been pushing forward
the frontier of the mind and senses, who had
opened his back-yard gate, as it were, upon the
boundless and mysterious territory of Nature.
There was Emerson, who was preaching an
intellectual independence of the Old World
which should correspond to the political and
social independence of the Western Hemisphere.
There was Parkman, whose hatred of
philanthropy, whose lack of spirituality, is a
striking illustration of the rebound of New
England idealism against itself, of the reaction
into stoicism. What different worlds these men
lived in, and yet they were all inhabitants, so to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
speak, of the same parish; most of them met
often around the same table! The lesson of
their variety of experience and differences of
gifts as workmen in that great palace of literature
which is so variously built, is that no action
and reaction in the imaginative world is ever
final. Least of all do these actions and reactions
affect the fortunes of true romance. The born
dreamer may fall from one dream into another,
but he still murmurs, in the famous line of
William Ellery Channing,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"If my bark sinks, 't is to another sea."</p></blockquote>

<p>No line in our literature is more truly American,&mdash;unless
it be that other splendid metaphor,
by David Wasson, which says the same
thing in other words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Life's gift outruns my fancies far,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And drowns the dream<br /></span>

Humor and Satire</h2>


<p>A distinguished professor in the Harvard
Divinity School once began a lecture on Comedy
by saying that the study of the comic had
made him realize for the first time that a joke
was one of the most solemn things in the world.
The analysis of humor is no easy matter. It is
hard to say which is the more dreary: an essay
on humor illustrated by a series of jokes,
or an exposition of humor in the technical
terms of philosophy. No subject has been more
constantly discussed. But it remains difficult to
decide what humor is. It is easier to declare
what seemed humorous to our ancestors, or
what seems humorous to us to-day. For humor
is a shifting thing. The well-known collections
of the writings of American humorists surprise
us by their revelation of the changes in public
taste. Humor&mdash;or the sense of humor&mdash;alters
while we are watching. What seemed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
good joke to us yesterday seems but a poor
joke to-day. And yet it is the same joke!
What is true of the individual is all the more
true of the national sense of humor. This vast
series of kaleidoscopic changes which we call
America; has it produced a humor of its own?</p>

<p>Let us avoid for the moment the treacherous
territory of definitions. Let us, rather, take
one concrete example: a pair of men, a knight
and his squire, who for three hundred years
have ridden together down the broad highway
of the world's imagination. Everybody sees
that Don Quixote and Sancho Panza are humorous.
Define them as you will&mdash;idealist
and realist, knight and commoner, dreamer
and proverb-maker&mdash;these figures represent
to all the world two poles of human experience.
A Frenchman once said that all of us are
Don Quixotes on one day and Sancho Panzas
on the next. Humor springs from this contrast.
It is the electric flash between the two
poles of experience.</p>

<p>Most philosophers who have meditated
upon the nature of the comic point out that it
is closely allied with the tragic. Flaubert once
compared our human idealism to the flight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
a swallow; at one moment it is soaring toward
the sunset, at the next moment some one
shoots it and it tumbles into the mud with
blood upon its glistening wings. The sudden
poignant contrast between light, space, freedom,
and the wounded bleeding bird in the
mud, is of the very essence of tragedy. But
something like that is always happening in comedy.
There is the same element of incongruity,
without the tragic consequence. It is only the
humorist who sees things truly because he sees
both the greatness and the littleness of mortals;
but even he may not know whether to
laugh or to cry at what he sees. Those collisions
and contrasts out of which the stuff of
tragedy is woven, such as the clash between the
higher and lower nature of a man, between his
past and his present, between one's duties to
himself and to his family or the state, between,
in a word, his character and his situation, are
all illustrated in comedy as completely as in
tragedy. The countryman in the city, the city
man in the country, is in a comic situation.
Here is a coward named Falstaff, and Shakespeare
puts him into battle. Here is a vain person, and
Malvolio is imprisoned and twitted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
a clown. Here is an ignoramus, and Dogberry
is placed on the judge's bench. These contrasts
might, indeed, be tragic enough, but they are
actually comic. Such characters are not ruled
by fate but by a sportive chance. The gods
connive at them. They are ruled, like tragic
characters, by necessity and blindness; but the
blindness, instead of leading to tragic ruin,
leads only to being caught as in some harmless
game of blind-man's-buff. There is retribution,
but Falstaff is only pinched by the fairies. Comedy
of intrigue and comedy of character lead
to no real catastrophe. The end of it on the
stage is not death but matrimony; and "home
well pleased we go."</p>

<p>A thousand definitions of humor lay stress
upon this element of incongruity. Hazlitt begins
his illuminating lectures on the Comic
Writers by declaring, "Man is the only animal
that laughs or weeps; for he is the only
animal that is struck with the difference between
what things are and what they ought to be."
James Russell Lowell took the same ground.
"Humor," he said once, "lies in the contrast
of two ideas. It is the universal disenchanter.
It is the sense of comic contradiction which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
arises from the perpetual comment which the
understanding makes upon the impressions received
through the imagination." If that sentence
seems too abstract, all we need do is to
think of Sancho Panza, the man of understanding,
talking about Don Quixote, the man of
imagination.</p>

<p>We must not multiply quotations, but it is
impossible not to remember the distinction
made by Carlyle in writing about Richter.
"True humor," says Carlyle, "springs not
more from the head than from the heart. It is
not contempt; its essence is love." In other
words, not merely the great humorists of the
world's literature&mdash;Cervantes, Rabelais, Fielding,
Thackeray, Dickens&mdash;but the writers of
comic paragraphs for to-morrow's newspaper,
all regard our human incongruities with a sort
of affection. The comic spirit is essentially a
social spirit. The great figures of tragedy are
solitary. The immortal figures of comedy belong
to a social group.</p>

<p>No recent discussion of humor is more illuminating
and more directly applicable to the
conditions of American life than that of the
contemporary French philosopher Bergson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Bergson insists throughout his brilliant little
book on <i>Laughter</i> that laughter is a social function.
Life demands elasticity. Hence whatever
is stiff, automatic, machine-like, excites a smile.
We laugh when a person gives us the impression
of being a thing,&mdash;a sort of mechanical toy.
Every inadaptation of the individual to society
is potentially comic. Thus laughter becomes
a social initiation. It is a kind of hazing which
we visit upon one another. But we do not isolate
the comic personage as we do the solitary,
tragic figure. The comic personage is usually
a type; he is one of an absurd group; he is a
miser, a pedant, a pretentious person, a doctor
or a lawyer in whom the professional traits
have become automatic so that he thinks more
of his professional behavior than he does of
human health and human justice. Of all these
separatist tendencies, laughter is the great corrective.
When the individual becomes set in
his ways, obstinate, preoccupied, automatic,
the rest of us laugh him out of it if we can.
Of course all that we are thinking about at
the moment is his ridiculousness. But nevertheless,
by laughing we become the saviors of
society.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>No one, I think, can help observing that
this conception of humor as incongruity is particularly
applicable to a new country. On the
new soil and under the new sky, in new social
groupings, all the fundamental contrasts and
absurdities of our human society assume a new
value. We see them under a fresh light. They
are differently focussed. The broad humors
of the camp, its swift and picturesque play of
light and shade, its farce and caricature no less
than its atmosphere of comradeship, of sentiment,
and of daring, are all transferred to the
humor of the newly settled country. The very
word "humor" once meant singularity of character,
"some extravagant habit, passion, or affection,"
says Dryden, "particular to some one
person." Every newly opened country encourages,
for a while, this oddness and incongruity
of individual character. It fosters it,
and at the same moment it laughs at it. It decides
that such characters are "humorous." As
the social conditions of such a country change,
the old pioneer instinct for humor, and the
pioneer forms of humor, may endure, though
the actual frontier may have moved far westward.</p>

<p>There is another conception of humor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
scarcely less famous than the notion of incongruity.
It is the conception associated with the
name of the English philosopher Hobbes, who
thought that humor turned upon a sense of
superiority. "The passion of laughter," said
Hobbes, "is nothing else but sudden glory
arising from some sudden conception of some
eminency in ourselves by comparison with the
inferiority of others, or with our own formerly."
Too cynical a view, declare many critics, but
they usually end by admitting that there is a
good deal in it after all. I am inclined to think
that Hobbes's famous definition is more applicable
to wit than it is to humor. Wit is more
purely intellectual than humor. It rejoices in
its little triumphs. It requires, as has been remarked,
a good head, while humor takes a
good heart, and fun good spirits. If you take
Carlyle literally when he says that humor is
love, you cannot wholly share Hobbes's conviction
that laughter turns upon a sense of
superiority, and yet surely we all experience a
sense of kindly amusement which turns upon
the fact that we, the initiated, are superior, for
the moment, to the unlucky person who is just
having his turn in being hazed. It may be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
play of intellect or the coarser play of animal
spirits. One might venture to make a distinction
between the low comedy of the Latin races
and the low comedy of the Germanic races
by pointing out that the superiority in the
Latin comedy usually turns upon quicker wits,
whereas the superiority in the Germanic farce
is likely to turn upon stouter muscles. But
whether it be a play of wits or of actual cudgelling,
the element of superiority and inferiority
is almost always there.</p>

<p>I remember that some German, I dare say
in a forgotten lecture-room, once illustrated the
humor of superiority in this way. A company
of strolling players sets up its tent in a country
village. On the front seat is a peasant,
laughing at the antics of the clown. The peasant
flatters himself that he sees through those
practical jokes on the stage; the clown ought
to have seen that he was about to be tripped
up, but he was too stupid. But the peasant
saw that it was coming all the time. He laughs
accordingly. Just behind the peasant sits the
village shopkeeper. He has watched stage
clowns many a time and he laughs, not at the
humor of the farce, but at the naïve laughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
of the peasant in front of him. He, the shopkeeper,
is superior to such broad and obvious
humor as that. Behind the shopkeeper sits the
schoolmaster. The schoolmaster is a pedant;
he has probably lectured to his boys on the
theory of humor, and he smiles in turn at the
smile of superiority on the face of the shopkeeper.
Well, peeping in at the door of the tent
is a man of the world, who glances at the clown,
then at the peasant, then at the shopkeeper,
then at the schoolmaster, each one of whom
is laughing at the others, and the man of the
world laughs at them all!</p>

<p>Let us take an even simpler illustration. We
all know the comfortable sense of proprietorship
which we experience after a few days' sojourn
at a summer hotel. We know our place
at the table; we call the head waiter by his first
name; we are not even afraid of the clerk. Now
into this hotel, where we sit throned in conscious
superiority, comes a new arrival. He has
not yet learned the exits and entrances. He
starts for the kitchen door inadvertently when
he should be headed for the drawing-room.
We smile at him. Why? Precisely because
that was what we did on the morning of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
own arrival. We have been initiated, and it is
now his turn.</p>

<p>If it is true that a newly settled country
offers endless opportunities for the humor
which turns upon incongruity, it is also true
that the new country offers countless occasions
for the humor which turns upon the sudden
glory of superiority. The backwoodsman is
amusing to the man of the settlements, and the
backwoodsman, in turn, gets his full share of
amusement out of watching the "tenderfoot"
in the woods. It is simply the case of the old
resident versus the newcomer. The superiority
need be in no sense a cruel or taunting superiority,
although it often happens to be so.
The humor of the pioneers is not very delicately
polished. The joke of the frontier tavern
or grocery store is not always adapted to a
drawing-room audience, but it turns in a surprisingly
large number of instances upon exactly
the same intellectual or social superiority
which gives point to the <i>bon mots</i> of the most
cultivated and artificial society in the world.</p>

<p>The humor arising from incongruity, then,
and the humor arising from a sense of superiority,
are both of them social in their nature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
No less social, surely, is the function of satire.
It is possible that satire may be decaying, that
it is becoming, if it has not already become, a
mere splendid or odious tradition. But let us
call it a great tradition and, upon the whole, a
splendid one. Even when debased to purely
party or personal uses, the verse satire of a
Dryden retains its magnificent resonance; "the
ring," says Saintsbury, "as of a great bronze
coin thrown down on marble." The malignant
couplets of an Alexander Pope still gleam like
malevolent jewels through the dust of two hundred
years. The cynicism, the misanthropy,
the mere adolescent badness of Byron are powerless
to clip the wings of the wide-ranging, far-darting
wit and humor and irony of <i>Don Juan</i>.
The homely Yankee dialect, the provinciality,
the "gnarly" flavor of the <i>Biglow Papers</i> do
not prevent our finding in that pungent and
resplendent satire the powers of Lowell at full
play; and, what is more than that, the epitome
of the American spirit in a moral crisis.</p>

<p>I take the names of those four satirists, Dryden,
Pope, Byron, and Lowell, quite at random;
but they serve to illustrate a significant principle;
namely, that great satire becomes ennobled as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
it touches communal, not merely individual
interests, as it voices social and not merely individual
ideals. Those four modern satirists
were steeped in the nationalistic political poetry
of the Old Testament. They were familiar with
its war anthems, dirges, and prophecies, its concern
for the prosperity and adversity, the sin
and the punishment, of a people. Here the
writers of the Golden Age of English satire
found their vocabulary and phrase-book, their
grammar of politics and history, their models
of good and evil kings; and in that Biblical
school of political poetry, which has affected our
literature from the Reformation down to Mr.
Kipling, there has always been a class in satire!
The satirical portraits, satirical lyrics, satirical
parables of the Old Testament prophets are
only less noteworthy than their audacity in
striking high and hard. Their foes were the all-powerful:
Babylon and Assyria and Egypt
loom vast and terrible upon the canvases of
Isaiah and Ezekiel; and poets of a later time
have learned there the secrets of social and political
idealism, and the signs of national doom.</p>

<p>There are two familiar types of satire associated
with the names of Horace and Juvenal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Both types are abundantly illustrated in English
and American literature. When you meet
a bore or a hypocrite or a plain rascal, is it better
to chastise him with laughter or to flay him
with shining fury? I shall take both horns of the
dilemma and assert that both methods are admirable
and socially useful. The minor English
and American poets of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries were never weary of speaking
of satire as a terrific weapon which they
were forced to wield as saviors of society. But
whether they belonged to the urbane school of
Horace, or to the severely moralistic school of
Juvenal, they soon found themselves falling
into one or the other of two modes of writing.
They addressed either the little audience or the
big audience, and they modified their styles accordingly.
The great satirists of the Renaissance,
for example, like More, Erasmus, and
Rabelais, wrote simply for the persons who
were qualified to understand them. More and
Erasmus wrote their immortal satires in Latin.
By so doing they addressed themselves to
cultivated Europe. They ran no risk of being
misunderstood by persons for whom the joke
was not intended. All readers of Latin were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
like members of one club. Of course membership
was restricted to the learned, but had not
Horace talked about being content with a few
readers, and was not Voltaire coming by and by
with the advice to try for the "little public"?</p>

<p>The typical wit of the eighteenth century,
whether in London, Paris, or in Franklin's
printing-shop in Philadelphia, had, of course,
abandoned Latin. But it still addressed itself
to the "little public," to the persons who were
qualified to understand. The circulation of the
<i>Spectator</i>, which represents so perfectly the wit,
humor, and satire of the early eighteenth century
in England, was only about ten thousand
copies. This limited audience smiled at the urbane
delicate touches of Mr. Steele and Mr.
Addison. They understood the allusions. The
fable concerned them and not the outsiders. It
was something like Oliver Wendell Holmes
reading his witty and satirical couplets to an
audience of Harvard alumni. The jokes are in
the vernacular, but in a vernacular as spoken
in a certain social medium. It is all very delightful.</p>

<p>But there is a very different kind of audience
gathering all this while outside the Harvard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
gates. These two publics for the humorist we
may call the invited and the uninvited; the inner
circle and the outer circle: first, those who
have tickets for the garden party, and who
stroll over the lawn, decorously gowned and
properly coated, conversing with one another
in the accepted social accents and employing
the recognized social adjectives; and second,
the crowd outside the gates,&mdash;curious, satirical,
good-natured in the main, straightforward
of speech and quick to applaud a ready wit or
a humor-loving eye or a telling phrase spoken
straight from the heart of the mob.</p>

<p>Will an author choose to address the selected
guests or the casual crowd? Either way lies
fame, if one does it well. Your uninvited men
find themselves talking to the uninvited crowd.
Before they know it they are famous too. They
are fashioning another manner of speech. Defoe
is there, with his saucy ballads selling triumphantly
under his very pillory; with his <i>True-Born
Englishman</i> puncturing forever the fiction
of the honorable ancestry of the English aristocracy;
with his <i>Crusoe</i> and <i>Moll Flanders</i>,
written, as Lamb said long afterwards, for the
servant-maid and the sailor. Swift is there, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
his terrific <i>Drapier's Letters</i>, anonymous, aimed
at the uneducated, with cold fury bludgeoning
a government into obedience; with his <i>Gulliver's
Travels</i>, so transparent upon the surface
that a child reads the book with delight and
remains happily ignorant that it is a satire upon
humanity. And then, into the London of Defoe
and Swift, and into the very centre of the middle-class
mob, steps, in 1724, the bland Benjamin
Franklin in search of a style "smooth, clear,
and short," and for half a century, with consummate
skill, shapes that style to his audience.
His young friend Thomas Paine takes the style
and touches it with passion, until he becomes
the perfect pamphleteer, and his <i>Crisis</i> is worth
as much to our Revolution&mdash;men said&mdash;as
the sword of Washington. After another generation
the gaunt Lincoln, speaking that same
plain prose of Defoe, Swift, Franklin, and Paine,&mdash;Lincoln
who began his first Douglas debate,
not like his cultivated opponent with the conventional
"Ladies and Gentlemen," but with
the ominously intimate, "My Fellow Citizens,"&mdash;Lincoln
is saying, "I am not master of language;
I have not a fine education; I am not
capable of entering into a disquisition upon dialectics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
as I believe you call it; but I do not
believe the language I employed bears any such
construction as Judge Douglas puts upon it.
But I don't care about a quibble in regard to
words. I know what I meant, and <i>I will not
leave this crowd in doubt</i>, if I can explain it to
them, what I really meant in the use of that
paragraph."</p>

<p>"<i>I will not leave this crowd in doubt</i>"; that is
the final accent of our spoken prose, the prose
addressed to one's fellow citizens, to the great
public. This is the prose spoken in the humor
and satire of Dickens. Dressed in a queer dialect,
and put into satirical verse, it is the language
of the <i>Biglow Papers</i>. Uttered with the
accent of a Chicago Irishman, it is the prose
admired by millions of the countrymen of
"Mr. Dooley."</p>

<p>Satire written to the "little public" tends
toward the social type; that written to the
"great public" to the political type. It is obvious
that just as a newly settled country offers
constant opportunity for the humor of incongruity
and the humor arising from a sense of
superiority, it likewise affords a daily stimulus
to the use of satire. That moralizing Puritan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
strain of censure which lost none of its harshness
in crossing the Atlantic Ocean found full
play in the colonial satire of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. As the topics for satire
grew wider and more political in their scope,
the audiences increased. To-day the very oldest
issues of the common life of that queer
"political animal" named man are discussed
by our popular newspaper satirists in the presence
of a democratic audience that stretches
from the Atlantic to the Pacific.</p>

<p>Is there, then, a distinctly American type of
humor and satire? I think it would be difficult
to prove that our composite American nationality
has developed a mode of humor and satire
which is racially different from the humor
and satire of the Old World. All racial lines
in literature are extremely difficult to draw. If
you attempt to analyze English humor, you
find that it is mostly Scotch or Irish. If you
put Scotch and Irish humor under the microscope,
you discover that most of the best
Scotch and Irish jokes are as old as the Greeks
and the Egyptians. You pick up a copy of
<i>Fliegende Blätter</i> and you get keen amusement
from its revelation of German humor. But how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
much of this humor, after all, is either essentially
universal in its scope or else a matter of
mere stage-setting and machinery? Without
the Prussian lieutenant the <i>Fliegende Blätter</i>
would lose half its point; nor can one imagine
a <i>Punch</i> without a picture of the English policeman.
The lieutenant and the policeman,
however, are a part of the accepted social furniture
of the two countries. They belong to the
decorative background of the social drama.
They heighten the effectiveness of local humor,
but it may be questioned whether they afford
any evidence of genuine racial differentiation as
to the sense of the comic.</p>

<p>What one can abundantly prove, however,
is that the United States afford a new national
field for certain types of humor and satire. Our
English friends are never weary of writing magazine
articles about Yankee humor, in which
they explain the peculiarities of the American
joke with a dogmatism which has sometimes
been thought to prove that there is such a
thing as national lack of humor, whether there
be such a thing as national humor or not. One
such article, I remember, endeavored to prove
that the exaggeration often found in American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
humor was due to the vastness of the American
continent. Our geography, that is to say,
is too much for the Yankee brain. Mr. Birrell,
an expert judge of humor, surely, thinks
that the characteristic of American humor lies
in its habit of speaking of something hideous
in a tone of levity. Many Englishmen, in fact,
have been as much impressed with this minimizing
trick of American humor as with the
converse trick of magnifying. Upon the Continent
the characteristic trait of American
humor has often been thought to be its exuberance
of phrase. Many shrewd judges of
our newspaper humor have pointed out that
one of its most favorite methods is the suppression
of one link in the chain of logical
reasoning. Such generalizations as these are
always interesting, although they may not take
us very far.</p>

<p>Yet it is clear that certain types of humor
and satire have proved to be specially adapted
to the American soil and climate. Whether or
not these types are truly indigenous one may
hesitate to say, yet it remains true that the well-known
conditions of American life have stimulated
certain varieties of humor into such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
richness of manifestation as the Old World can
scarcely show.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, one of the most perfected
types of American humor is that urbane Horatian
variety which has often been held to be
the exclusive possession of the cultivated and
restricted societies of older civilization. Yet it
is precisely this kind of humor which has been
the delight of some of the most typical American
minds. Benjamin Franklin, for example,
modelled his style and his sense of the humorous
on the papers of the <i>Spectator</i>. He produced
humorous fables and apologues, choice
little morsels of social and political persiflage,
which were perfectly suited, not merely to the
taste of London in the so-called golden age of
English satire, but to the tone of the wittiest
salons of Paris in the age when the old régime
went tottering, talking, quoting, jesting to its
fall. Read Franklin's charming and wise letter
to Madame Brillon about giving too much
for the whistle. It is the perfection of well-bred
humor: a humor very American, very
Franklinian, although its theme and tone and
phrasing might well have been envied by Horace
or Voltaire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>The gentle humor of Irving is marked by
precisely those traits of urbanity and restraint
which characterize the parables of Franklin.
Does not the <i>Autocrat of the Breakfast Table</i>
itself presuppose the existence of a truly cultivated
society? Its tone&mdash;"As I was saying
when I was interrupted"&mdash;is the tone of the intimate
circle. There was so much genuine humanity
in the gay little doctor that persons born
outside the circle of Harvard College and the
North Shore and Boston felt themselves at once
initiated by the touch of his merry wand into
a humanized, kindly theory of life. The humor
of George William Curtis had a similarly
mellow and ripened quality. It is a curious
comment upon that theory of Americans which
represents us primarily as a loud-voiced, assertive,
headstrong people, to be thus made
aware that many of the humorists whom we
have loved best are precisely those whose writing
has been marked by the most delicate restraint,
whose theory of life has been the most
highly urbane and civilized, whose work is indistinguishable
in tone&mdash;though its materials
are so different&mdash;from that of other humorous
writers on the other side of the Atlantic. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
its social side all this is a fresh proof of the extraordinary
adaptability of the American mind.
On the literary side it is one more evidence
of the national fondness for neatness and perfection
of workmanship.</p>

<p>But we are something other than a nation of
mere lovers and would-be imitators of Charles
Lamb. The moralistic type of humor, the crack
of Juvenal's whip, as well as the delicate Horatian
playing around the heart-strings, has
characterized our humor and satire from the
beginning. At bottom the American is serious.
Beneath the surface of his jokes there is moral
earnestness, there is ethical passion. Take, for
example, some of the apothegms of "Josh
Billings." He failed with the public until he
took up the trick of misspelling his words.
When he had once gained his public he sometimes
delighted them with sheer whimsical incongruity,
like this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"There iz 2 things in this life for which we
are never fully prepared, and that iz twins."</p></blockquote>

<p>But more often the tone is really grave. It
is only the spelling that is queer. The moralizing
might be by La Bruyère or La Rochefoucauld.
Take this:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Life iz short, but it iz long enuff to ruin
enny man who wants tew be ruined."</p></blockquote>

<p>Or this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"When a feller gits a goin doun hill, it dus
seem as tho evry thing had bin greased for the
okashun." That is what writers of tragedy
have been showing, ever since the Greeks!</p></blockquote>

<p>Or finally, this, which has the perfect tone
of the great French moralists:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"It iz a verry delicate job to forgive a man
without lowering him in his own estimashun,
and yures too."</p></blockquote>

<p>See how the moralistic note is struck in the
field of political satire. It is 1866, and "Petroleum
V. Nasby," writing from "Confedrit
X Roads," Kentucky, gives Deekin Pogram's
views on education. "He didn't bleeve in
edjucashun, generally speekin. The common
people was better off without it, ez edjucashun
hed a tendency to unsettle their minds. He
had seen the evil effex ov it in niggers and poor
whites. So soon ez a nigger masters the spellin
book and gits into noosepapers, he becomes
dissatisfied with his condishin, and hankers
after a better cabin and more wages. He towunst
begins to insist onto ownin land hisself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
and givin his children edjucashun, and, ez a nigger,
for our purposes, aint worth a soo markee."</p>

<p>The single phrase, "ez a nigger," spells
a whole chapter of American history.</p>

<p>That quotation from "Petroleum V. Nasby"
serves also to illustrate a species of American
humor which has been of immense historical
importance and which has never been more
active than it is to-day: the humor, namely, of
local, provincial, and sectional types. Much of
this falls under Bergson's conception of humor
as social censure. It rebukes the extravagance,
the rigidity, the unawareness of the individual
who fails to adapt himself to his social environment.
It takes the place, in our categories of
humor, of those types of class humor and
satire in which European literature is so rich.
The mobility of our population, the constant
shifting of professions and callings, has prevented
our developing fixed class types of
humor. We have not even the lieutenant or
the policeman as permanent members of our
humorous stock company. The policeman of
to-day may be mayor or governor to-morrow.
The lieutenant may go back to his grocery
wagon or on to his department store. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
whenever and wherever such an individual fails
to adapt himself to his new companions, fails
to take on, as it were, the colors of his new
environment, to speak in the new social accents,
to follow the recognized patterns of behavior,
then the kindly whip of the humorist is already
cracking round his ears. The humor and satire
of college undergraduate journalism turns
mainly upon the recognized ability or inability
of different individuals to adapt themselves to
their changing pigeon-holes in the college organism.
A freshman must behave like a freshman,
or he is laughed at. Yet he must not behave
as if he were nothing but the automaton
of a freshman, or he will be laughed at more
merrily still.</p>

<p>One of the first discoveries of our earlier
humorists was the Down-East Yankee. "I'm
going to Portland whether or no," says Major
Jack Downing, telling the story of his boyhood;
"I'll see what this world is made of yet.
So I tackled up the old horse and packed in a
load of ax handles and a few notions, and mother
fried me a few doughnuts ... for I told
her I didn't know how long I should be gone,"&mdash;and
off he goes to Portland, to see what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
world is made of. It is a little like Defoe, and
a good deal like the young Ulysses, bent upon
knowing cities and men and upon getting the
best of bargains.</p>

<p>Each generation of Americans has known
something like that trip to Portland. Each
generation has had to measure its wits, its resources,
its manners, against new standards of
comparison. At every stage of the journey
there are mishaps and ridiculous adventures;
but everywhere, likewise, there is zest, conquest,
initiation; the heart of a boy who "wants
to know"&mdash;as the Yankees used to say; or,
in more modern phrase,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"to admire and for to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to behold this world so wide."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is the same romance of adventure in
the humor concerning the Irishman, the Negro,
the Dutchman, the Dago, the farmer. Each in
turn becomes humorous through failure to
adapt himself to the prevalent type. A long-bearded
Jew is not ridiculous in Russia, but he
rapidly becomes ridiculous even on the East
Side of New York. Underneath all this popular
humor of the comic supplements one may
catch glimpses of the great revolving wheels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
which are crushing the vast majority of our
population into something like uniformity. It
is a process of social attrition. The sharp edges
of individual behavior get rounded off. The
individual loses color and picturesqueness, precisely
as he casts aside the national costume of
the land from which he came. His speech, his
gait, his demeanor, become as nearly as possible
like the speech and carriage of all his
neighbors. If he resists, he is laughed at; and if
he does not personally heed the laughter, he
may be sure that his children do. It is the children
of our immigrants who catch the sly smiles
of their school-fellows, who overhear jokes
from the newspapers and on the street corners,
who bring home to their foreign-born fathers
and mothers the imperious childish demand to
make themselves like unto everybody else.</p>

<p>A similar social function is performed by that
well-known mode of American humor which
ridicules the inhabitants of certain states. Why
should New Jersey, for example, be more ridiculous
than Delaware? In the eyes of the newspaper
paragrapher it unquestionably is, just as
Missouri has more humorous connotations than
Kentucky. We may think we understand why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
we smile when a man says that he comes from
Kalamazoo or Oshkosh, but the smile when he
says "Philadelphia" or "Boston" or "Brooklyn"
is only a trifle more subtle. It is none the
less real. Why should the suburban dweller of
every city be regarded with humorous condescension
by the man who is compelled to sleep
within the city limits? No one can say, and yet
without that humor of the suburbs the comic
supplements of American newspapers would
be infinitely less entertaining,&mdash;to the people
who enjoy comic supplements.</p>

<p>So it is with the larger divisions of our national
life. Yankee, Southerner, Westerner,
Californian, Texan, each type provokes certain
connotations of humor when viewed by any of
the other types. Each type in turn has its note
of provinciality when compared with the norm
of the typical American. It is quite possible to
maintain that our literature, like our social life,
has suffered by this ever-present American sense
of the ridiculous. Our social consciousness
might be far more various and richly colored,
there might be more true provincial independence
of speech and custom and imagination if
we had not to reckon with this ever-present censure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of laughter, this fear of finding ourselves,
our city, our section, out of touch with the prevalent
tone and temper of the country as a
whole. It is one of the forfeits we are bound to
pay when we play the great absorbing game of
democracy.</p>

<p>We are now ready to ask once more whether
there is a truly national type of American humor.
Viewed exclusively from the standpoint
of racial characteristics, we have seen that this
question as to a national type of humor is difficult
to answer. But we have seen with equal
clearness that the United States has offered a
singularly rich field for the development of the
sense of humor; and furthermore that there
are certain specialized forms of humor which
have flourished luxuriantly upon our soil. Our
humorists have made the most of their native
materials. Every pioneer trait of versatility,
curiosity, shrewdness, has been turned somehow
to humorous account. The very institutions
of democracy, moulding day by day and
generation after generation the habits and the
mental characteristics of millions of men, have
produced a social atmosphere in which humor
is one of the most indisputable elements.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>I recall a notable essay by Mr. Charles Johnston
on the essence of American humor in which
he applies to the conditions of American life
one familiar distinction between humor and wit.
Wit, he asserts, scores off the other man, humor
does not. Wit frequently turns upon tribal
differences, upon tribal vanity. The mordant
wit of the Jew, for example, from the
literature of the Old Testament down to the
raillery of Heine, has turned largely upon the
sense of racial superiority, of intellectual and
moral differences. But true humor, Mr. Johnston
goes on to argue, has always a binding, a
uniting quality. Thus Huckleberry Finn and
Jim Hawkins, white man and black man, are
afloat together on the Mississippi River raft and
they are made brethren by the fraternal quality
of Mark Twain's humor. Thus the levelling
quality of Bret Harte's humor bridges social
and moral chasms. It creates an atmosphere
of charity and sympathy. In fact, the typical
American humor, according to the opinion of
Mr. Johnston, emphasizes the broad and humane
side of our common nature. It reveals
the common soul. It possesses a surplusage of
power, of buoyancy and of conquest over circumstances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
It means at its best a humanizing
of our hearts.</p>

<p>Some people will think that all this is too
optimistic, but if you are not optimistic enough
you cannot keep up with the facts. Certain it
is that the pioneers of American national humor,
the creators of what we may call the "all-American"
type of humor, have possessed precisely
the qualities which Mr. Johnston has
pointed out. They are apparent in the productions
of Artemus Ward. The present generation
vaguely remembers Artemus Ward as
the man who was willing to send all his wife's
relatives to the war and who, standing by the
tomb of Shakespeare, thought it "a success."
But no one who turns to the almost forgotten
pages of that kindly jester can fail to be impressed
by his sunny quality, by the atmosphere
of fraternal affection which glorifies his queer
spelling and his somewhat threadbare witticisms.
Mark Twain, who is universally recognized
by Europeans as a representative of
typical American humor, had precisely those
qualities of pioneer curiosity, swift versatility,
absolute democracy, which are characteristic
of the national temper. His lively accounts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
frontier experiences in <i>Roughing It</i>, his comments
upon the old world in <i>Innocents Abroad</i>
and <i>A Tramp Abroad</i>, his hatred of pretence
and injustice, his scorn at sentimentality coupled
with his insistence upon the rights of sentiment,
in a word his persistent idealism, make Mark
Twain one of the most representative of American
writers. Largeness, freedom, human sympathy,
are revealed upon every page.</p>

<p>It is true that the dangers of American humor
are no less in evidence there. There is the
danger of extravagance, which in Mark Twain's
earlier writings was carried to lengths of absurdity.
There is the old danger of the professional
humorist of fearing to fail to score his
point, and so of underscoring it with painful
reiteration. Mark Twain is frequently grotesque.
Sometimes there is evidence of imperfect
taste, or of bad taste. Sometimes there is
actual vulgarity. In his earlier books particularly
there is revealed that lack of discipline
which has been such a constant accompaniment
of American writing. Yet a native of Hannibal,
Missouri, trained on a river steamboat and
in a country printing-office and in mining-camps,
can scarcely be expected to exhibit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
finely balanced critical sense of a Matthew Arnold.
Mark Twain was often accused in the
first years of his international reputation of a
characteristically American lack of reverence.
He is often irreverent. But here again the
boundaries of his irreverence are precisely those
which the national instinct itself has drawn.
The joke stops short of certain topics which the
American mind holds sacred. We all have our
favorite pages in the writings of this versatile
and richly endowed humorist, but I think no
one can read his description of the coyote in
<i>Roughing It</i>, and Huckleberry Finn's account
of his first visit to the circus, without realizing
that in this fresh revelation of immemorial
human curiosity, this vivid perception of incongruity
and surprise, this series of lightning-like
flashes from one pole of experience to the
other, we have not only masterpieces of world
humor, but a revelation of a distinctly American
reaction to the facts presented by universal
experience.</p>

<p>The picturesque personality and the extraordinarily
successful career of Mark Twain
kept him, during the last twenty-five years of
his life, in the focus of public attention. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
no one can read the pages of the older American
humorists,&mdash;or try to recall to mind the
names of paragraphers who used to write comic
matter for this or that newspaper,&mdash;without
realizing how swiftly the dust of oblivion settles
upon all the makers of mere jokes. It is
enough, perhaps, that they caused a smile for
the moment. Even those humorists who mark
epochs in the history of American provincial
and political satire, like Seba Smith with his
<i>Major Jack Downing</i>, Newell with his <i>Papers
of Orpheus C. Kerr</i>, "Petroleum V. Nasby's"
<i>Letters from the Confedrit X Roads</i>, Shillaber's
<i>Mrs. Partington</i>&mdash;all these have disappeared
round the turn of the long road.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hans Breitman gife a barty&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vhere ish dot barty now?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It seems as if the conscious humorists, the
professional funny writers, had the shortest
lease of literary life. They play their little comic
parts before a well-disposed but restless audience
which is already impatiently waiting for
some other "turn." One of them makes a hit
with a song or story, just as a draughtsman for
a Sunday colored supplement makes a hit with
his "Mutt and Jeff." For a few months everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
smiles and then comes the long oblivion.
The more permanent American humor has
commonly been written by persons who were
almost unconscious, not indeed of the fact that
they were creating humorous characters, but
unconscious of the effort to provoke a laugh.
The smile lasts longer than the laugh. Perhaps
that is the secret. One smiles as one reads the
delicate sketches of Miss Jewett. One smiles
over the stories of Owen Wister and of Thomas
Nelson Page. The trouble, possibly, with the
enduring qualities of the brilliant humorous
stories of "O. Henry" was that they tempt
the reader to laugh too much and to smile too
little. When one reads the <i>Legend of Sleepy
Hollow</i> or <i>Diedrich Knickerbocker's History of
New York</i>, it is always with this gentle parting
of the lips, this kindly feeling toward the
author, his characters and the world. A humorous
page which produces that effect for generation
after generation, has the stamp of literature.
One may doubt whether even the extraordinary
fantasies of Mark Twain are more successful,
judged by the mere vulgar test of concrete
results, than the delicate humor of Charles
Lamb. Our current newspaper and magazine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
humor is in no respect more fascinating than
in its suggestion as to the permanent effectiveness
of its comic qualities. Who could say,
when he first read Mr. Finley P. Dunne's
"Mr. Dooley" sketches, whether this was
something that a whole nation of readers would
instantly and instinctively rejoice over, would
find a genial revelation of American characteristics,
would recognize as almost the final word
of kindly satire upon our overworked, over-excited,
over-anxious, over-self-conscious generation?</p>

<p>The range of this contemporary newspaper
and magazine humor is well-nigh universal,&mdash;always
saving, it is true, certain topics or states
of mind which the American public cannot
regard as topics for laughter. With these few
exceptions nothing is too high or too low for
it. The paragraphers joke about the wheel-barrow,
the hen, the mule, the mother-in-law,
the President of the United States. There is
no ascending or descending scale of importance.
Any of the topics can raise a laugh. If
one examines a collection of American parodies,
one will find that the happy national talent
for fun-making finds full scope in the parody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
and burlesque of the dearest national sentiments.
But no one minds; everybody believes
that the sentiments endure while the jokes will
pass. The jokes, intended as they are for an
immense audience, necessarily lack subtlety.
They tend to partake of the methods of pictorial
caricature. Indeed, caricature itself, as
Bergson has pointed out, emphasizes those
"automatic, mechanical-toy" traits of character
and behavior which isolate the individual
and make him ill adapted for his function in
society. Our verbal wit and humor, no less
than the pencil of our caricaturists, have this
constant note of exaggeration. "These violent
delights have violent ends." But during
their brief and laughing existence they serve
to normalize society. They set up, as it were,
a pulpit in the street upon which the comic
spirit may mount and preach her useful sermon
to all comers.</p>

<p>Despite the universality of the objects of
contemporary American humor, despite, too,
its prevalent method of caricature, it remains
true that its character is, on the whole, clean,
easy-going, and kindly. The old satire of hatred
has lost its force. No one knows why. "Satire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
has grown weak," says Mr. Chesterton, "precisely
because belief has grown weak." That
is one theory. The late Henry D. Lloyd, of
Chicago, declared in one of his last books:
"The world has outgrown the dialect and temper
of hatred. The style of the imprecatory
psalms and the denunciating prophets is out of
date. No one knows these times if he is not
conscious of this change." That is another
theory. Again, party animosities are surely
weaker than they were. Caricatures are less personally
offensive; if you doubt it, look at any
of the collections of caricatures of Napoleon,
or of George the Fourth. Irony is less often
used by pamphleteers and journalists. It is a
delicate rhetorical weapon, and journalists who
aim at the great public are increasingly afraid
to use it, lest the readers miss the point. In
the editorials in the Hearst newspapers, for
instance, there is plenty of invective and innuendo,
but rarely irony: it might not be understood,
and the crowd must not be left in
doubt.</p>

<p>Possibly the old-fashioned satire has disappeared
because the game is no longer considered
worth the candle. To puncture the tire of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
pretence is amusing enough; but it is useless to
stick tacks under the steam road-roller: the
road-roller advances remorselessly and smooths
down your mischievous little tacks and you
too, indifferently. The huge interests of politics,
trade, progress, override your passionate
protest. "Shall gravitation cease when you
go by?" I do not compare Colonel Roosevelt
with gravitation, but have all the satirical squibs
against our famous contemporary, from the
"Alone in Cubia" to the "Teddy-see," ever
cost him, in a dozen years, a dozen votes?</p>

<p>Very likely Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Chesterton
are right. We are less censorious than our ancestors
were. Americans, on the whole, try to
avoid giving pain through speech. The satirists
of the golden age loved that cruel exercise
of power. Perhaps we take things less
seriously than they did; undoubtedly our attention
is more distracted and dissipated. At
any rate, the American public finds it easier to
forgive and forget, than to nurse its wrath to
keep it warm. Our characteristic humor of
understatement, and our equally characteristic
humor of overstatement, are both likely to be
cheery at bottom, though the mere wording<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
may be grim enough. No popular saying is
more genuinely characteristic of American humor
than the familiar "Cheer up. The worst
is yet to come."</p>

<p>Whatever else one may say or leave unsaid
about American humor, every one realizes that
it is a fundamentally necessary reaction from
the pressure of our modern living. Perhaps it
is a handicap. Perhaps we joke when we should
be praying. Perhaps we make fun when we
ought to be setting our shoulders to the wheel.
But the deeper fact is that most American
shoulders are set to the wheel too often and
too long, and if they do not stop for the joke
they are done for. I have always suspected
that Mr. Kipling was thinking of American
humor when he wrote in his well-known lines
on "The American Spirit":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So imperturbable he rules<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unkempt, disreputable, vast&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the teeth of all the schools<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I&mdash;I shall save him at the last."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That is the very secret of the American sense
of humor: the conviction that something is
going to save us at the last. Otherwise there
would be no joke! It is no accident, surely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
that the man who is increasingly idolized as the
most representative of all Americans, the burden-bearer
of his people, the man of sorrows
and acquainted with grief, should be our most
inveterate humorist. Let Lincoln have his story
and his joke, for he had faith in the saving of
the nation; and while his Cabinet are waiting
impatiently to listen to his Proclamation of
Emancipation, give him another five minutes
to read aloud to them that new chapter by
Artemus Ward.</p>

Individualism and Fellowship</h2>


<p>It would be difficult to find a clearer expression
of the old doctrine of individualism than
is uttered by Carlyle in his London lecture on
"The Hero as Man of Letters." Listen to the
grim child of Calvinism as he fires his "Annandale
grapeshot" into that sophisticated London
audience: "Men speak too much about the
world.... The world's being saved will not
save us; nor the world's being lost destroy us.
We should look to ourselves.... For the
saving of the world I will trust confidently to
the Maker of the world; and look a little to my
own saving, which I am more competent to!"</p>

<p>Carlyle was never more soundly Puritanic,
never more perfectly within the lines of the
moral traditions of his race than in these injunctions
to let the world go and to care for
the individual soul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>We are familiar with the doctrine on this
side of the Atlantic. Here is a single phrase
from Emerson's <i>Journal</i> of September, 1833,
written on his voyage home from that memorable
visit to Europe where he first made
Carlyle's acquaintance. "Back again to myself,"
wrote Emerson, as the five-hundred-ton
sailing ship beat her way westward for a long
month across the stormy North Atlantic:&mdash;"Back
again to myself.&mdash;A man contains all
that is needful to his government within himself.
He is made a law unto himself. All real
good or evil that can befall him must be from
himself.... The purpose of life seems to be
to acquaint a man with himself."</p>

<p>In the following August he is writing:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Societies, parties, are only incipient stages,
tadpole states of men, as caterpillars are social,
but the butterfly not. The true and finished
man is ever alone."</p></blockquote>

<p>On March 23, 1835:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Alone is wisdom. Alone is happiness.
Society nowadays makes us low-spirited,
hopeless. Alone is Heaven."</p></blockquote>

<p>And once more:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p><blockquote><p>"If Æschylus is that man he is taken for,
he has not yet done his office when he has educated
the learned of Europe for a thousand
years. He is now to approve himself a master
of delight to me. If he cannot do that, all his
fame shall avail him nothing. I were a fool not
to sacrifice a thousand Æschyluses to my intellectual
integrity."</p></blockquote>

<p>These quotations have to do with the personal
life. Let me next illustrate the individualism
of the eighteen-thirties by the attitude
of two famous individualists toward the prosaic
question of paying taxes to the State. Carlyle
told Emerson that he should pay taxes to the
House of Hanover just as long as the House
of Hanover had the physical force to collect
them,&mdash;and not a day longer.</p>

<p>Henry Thoreau was even more recalcitrant.
Let me quote him:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have paid no poll-tax for six years. I was
put into a jail once on this account, for one
night; and, as I stood considering the walls of
solid stone, two or three feet thick, the door
of wood and iron, a foot thick, and the iron
grating which strained the light, I could not
help being struck with the foolishness of that
institution which treated me as if I were mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
flesh and blood and bones, to be locked up. I
wondered that it should have concluded at
length that this was the best use it could put
me to, and had never thought to avail itself of
my services in some way. I saw that, if there
was a wall of stone between me and my townsmen,
there was a still more difficult one to climb
or break through before they could get to be as
free as I was. I did not for a moment feel confined,
and the walls seemed a great waste of stone
and mortar. I felt as if I alone of all my townsmen
had paid my tax. They plainly did not
know how to treat me, but behaved like persons
who are underbred. In every threat and
in every compliment there was a blunder; for
they thought that my chief desire was to stand
on the other side of that stone wall. I could not
but smile to see how industriously they locked
the door on my meditations, which followed
them out again without let or hindrance, and
<i>they</i> were really all that was dangerous. As they
could not reach me, they had resolved to punish
my body; just as boys, if they cannot come
at some person against whom they have a spite,
will abuse his dog. I saw that the State was
half-witted, that it was timid as a lone woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
with her silver spoons, and that it did not know
its friends from its foes, and I lost all my remaining
respect for it, and pitied it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is Thoreau's attitude toward the problems
of the inner life. The three quotations
are from his <i>Walden</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Probably I should not consciously and deliberately
forsake my particular calling to do
the good which society demands of me, to save
the universe from annihilation."</p>

<p>"I went to the woods because I wished to
live deliberately, to front only the essential
facts of life, and see if I could not learn what
it had to teach, and not, when I came to die,
discover that I had not lived. I did not wish
to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor
did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was
quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck
out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily
and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was
not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close,
to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its
lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why
then to get the whole and genuine meanness
of it, and publish its meanness to the world;
or if it were sublime, to know it by experience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
and be able to give a true account of it in my
next excursion."</p>

<p>"It is said that the British Empire is very
large and respectable, and that the United States
are a first-rate power. We do not believe that
a tide rises and falls behind every man which
can float the British Empire like a chip, if he
should ever harbor it in his mind."</p>

<p>All of these quotations from Emerson and
Thoreau are but various modes of saying "Let
the world go." Everybody knows that in later
crises of American history, both Thoreau and
Emerson forgot their old preaching of individualism,
or at least merged it in the larger
doctrine of identification of the individual with
the acts and emotions of the community. And
nevertheless as men of letters they habitually
laid stress upon the rights and duties of the
private person. Upon a hundred brilliant pages
they preached the gospel that society is in conspiracy
against the individual manhood of every
one of its members.</p>

<p>They had a right to this doctrine. They came
by it honestly through long lines of ancestral
heritage. The republicanism of the seventeenth
century in the American forests, as well as upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
the floor of the English House of Commons,
had asserted that private persons had the right
to make and unmake kings. The republican
theorists of the eighteenth century had insisted
that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
were the birthright of each individual. This
doctrine was related, of course, to the doctrine
of equality. If republicanism teaches that "I
am as good as others," democracy is forever
hinting "Others are as good as I." Democracy
has been steadily extending the notion of rights
and duties. The first instinct, perhaps, is to
ask what is right, just, lawful, for me? Next,
what is right, just, lawful for my crowd? That
is to say, my family, my clan, my race, my country.
The third instinct bids one ask what is
right and just and lawful, not merely for me,
and for men like me, but for everybody. And
when we get that third question properly answered,
we can afford to close school-house and
church and court-room, for this world's work
will have ended.</p>

<p>We have already glanced at various phases
of colonial individualism. We have had a
glimpse of Cotton Mather prostrate upon the
dusty floor of his study, agonizing now for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
himself and now for the countries of Europe;
we have watched Jonathan Edwards in his
solitary ecstasies in the Northampton and the
Stockbridge woods; we have seen Franklin
preaching his gospel of personal thrift and of
getting on in the world. Down to the very
verge of the Revolution the American pioneer
spirit was forever urging the individual to fight
for his own hand. Each boy on the old farms
had his own chores to do; each head of a family
had to plan for himself. The most tragic
failure of the individual in those days was the
poverty or illness which compelled him to "go
on the town." To be one of the town poor indicated
that the individualistic battle had been
fought and lost. No one ever dreamed, apparently,
that a time for old-age pensions and
honorable retiring funds was coming. The feeling
against any form of community assistance
was like the bitter hatred of the workhouse
among English laborers of the eighteen-forties.</p>

<p>The stress upon purely personal qualities
gave picturesqueness, color, and vigor to the
early life of the United States. Take the persons
whom Parkman describes in his <i>Oregon
Trail</i>. They have the perfect clearness of outline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
of the portraits by Walter Scott and the
great Romantic school of novelists who loved
to paint pictures of interesting individual men.
There is the same stress upon individualistic
portraiture in Irving's <i>Astoria</i>; in the humorous
journals of early travellers in the Southern
States. It is the secret of the curiosity with
which we observe the gamblers and miners and
stage-drivers described by Bret Harte. In the
rural communities of to-day, in the older portions
of the country, and in the remoter settlements
of the West and Southwest, the individual
man has a sort of picturesque, and, as it
were, artistic value, which the life of cities does
not allow. The gospel of self-reliance and of
solitude is not preached more effectively by
the philosophers of Concord than it is by the
backwoodsmen, the spies, and the sailors of
Fenimore Cooper. Individualism as a doctrine
of perfection for the private person and individualism
as a literary creed have thus gone
hand in hand. "Produce great persons, the rest
follows," cried Walt Whitman. He was thinking
at the moment about American society and
politics. But he believed that the same law held
good in poetry. Once get your great man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
let him abandon himself to poetry and the
great poetry will be the result. It was almost
precisely the same teaching as in Carlyle's lecture
on "The Hero as Poet."</p>

<p>Well, it is clear enough nowadays that both
Whitman and Carlyle underrated the value of
discipline. The lack of discipline is the chief
obstacle to effective individualism. The private
person must be well trained, or he cannot
do his work; and as civilization advances, it
becomes exceedingly difficult to train the individual
without social coöperation. A Paul or a
Mahomet may discipline his own soul in the
Desert of Arabia; he may there learn the lessons
that may later make him a leader of men.
But for the average man and indeed for most
of the exceptional men, the path to effectiveness
lies through social and professional discipline.
Here is where the frontier stage of our
American life was necessarily weak. We have
seen that our ancestors gained something, no
doubt, from their spirit of unconventionally
and freedom. But they also lost something
through their dislike for discipline, their indifference
to criticism, their ineradicable tendency,
whether in business, in diplomacy, in art and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
letters and education, to go "across lots." A
certain degree of physical orderliness was, indeed,
imposed upon our ancestors by the conditions
of pioneer life. The natural prodigality
and recklessness of frontier existence was here
and there sharply checked. Order is essential
in a camp, and the thin line of colonies was
all camping. A certain instinct for order underlay
that resourcefulness which impresses every
reader of our history. Did the colonist need a
tool? He learned to make it himself. Isolation
from the mother country was a stimulus
to the inventive imagination. Before long they
were maintaining public order in the same
ingenious fashion in which they kept house.
Appeals to London took too much time. "We
send a complaint this year," ran the saying,
"the next year they send to inquire, the third
year the ministry is changed." No wonder that
resourcefulness bred independent action, stimulated
the Puritan taste for individualism, and
led the way to self-government.</p>

<p>Yet who does not know that the inherent
instinct for political order may be accompanied
by mental disorderliness? Even your modern
Englishman&mdash;as the saying goes&mdash;"muddles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
through." The minds of our American forefathers
were not always lucid. The mysticism
of the New England Calvinists sometimes bred
fanaticism. The practical and the theoretical
were queerly blended. The essential unorderliness
of the American mind is admirably illustrated
by that "Father of all the Yankees,"
Benjamin Franklin. No student of Franklin's
life fails to be impressed by its happy casualness,
its cheerful flavor of the rogue-romance.
Gil Blas himself never drifted into and out of
an adventure with a more offhand and imperturbable
adroitness. Franklin went through life
with the joyous inventiveness of the amateur.
He had the amateur's enthusiasm, coupled with
a clairvoyant penetration into technical problems
such as few amateurs have possessed. With
all of his wonderful patience towards other men,
Franklin had in the realm of scientific experiment
something of the typical impatience of
the mere dabbler. He was inclined to lose interest
in the special problem before it was worked
out. His large, tolerant intelligence was often
as unorderly as his papers and accounts. He
was a wonderful colonial Jack-of-all-trades;
with a range of suggestion, a resourcefulness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
a knack of assimilation, a cosmopolitan many-sidedness,
which has left us perpetually his debtors.
Under different surroundings, and disciplined
by a more severe and orderly training,
Franklin might easily have developed the very
highest order of professional scientific achievement.
His natural talent for organization of
men and institutions, his "early projecting public
spirit," his sense of the lack of formal educational
advantages in the colonies, made him
the founder of the Philadelphia Academy, the
successful agitator for public libraries. Academicism,
even in the narrow sense, owes much to
this LL.D. of St. Andrews, D.C.L. of Oxford,
and intimate associate of French academicians.
But one smiles a little, after all, to see the bland
printer in this academic company: he deserves
his place there, indeed, but he is something
more and other than his associates. He is the
type of youthful, inexhaustible colonial America;
reckless of precedent, self-taught, splendidly
alive; worth, to his day and generation, a
dozen born academicians; and yet suggesting
by his very imperfections, that the Americans
of a later day, working under different conditions,
are bound to develop a sort of professional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
skill, of steady, concentrated, ordered intellectual
activity, for which Franklin possessed
the potential capacity rather than the opportunity
and the desire.</p>

<p>Yet there were latent lines of order, hints and
prophecies of a coming fellowship, running
deep and straight beneath the confused surface
of the preoccupied colonial consciousness. In another
generation we see the rude Western democracy
asserting itself in the valley of the Mississippi.
This breed of pioneers, like their
fathers on the Atlantic coast line, could turn
their hands to anything, because they must.
"The average man," says Mr. Herbert Croly,
"without any special bent or qualifications, was
in the pioneer states the useful man. In that
country it was sheer waste to spend much energy
upon tasks which demanded skill, prolonged
experience, high technical standards, or
exclusive devotion.... No special equipment
was required. The farmer was obliged to be all
kinds of a rough mechanic. The business man
was merchant, manufacturer, and storekeeper.
Almost everybody was something of a politician.
The number of parts which a man of
energy played in his time was astonishingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
large. Andrew Jackson was successively a lawyer,
judge, planter, merchant, general, politician,
and statesman; and he played most of these
parts with conspicuous success. In such a society
a man who persisted in one job, and who
applied the most rigorous and exacting standards
to his work, was out of place and really inefficient.
His finished product did not serve its
temporary purpose much better than did the
current careless and hasty product, and his
higher standards and peculiar ways constituted
an implied criticism on the easy methods of his
neighbors. He interfered with the rough good-fellowship
which naturally arises among a group
of men who submit good naturedly and uncritically
to current standards. It is no wonder, consequently,
that the pioneer Democracy viewed
with distrust and aversion the man with a special
vocation and high standards of achievement."</p>

<p>The truth of this comment is apparent to
everybody. It explains the still lingering popular
suspicion of the "academic" type of man.
But we are likely to forget that back of all that
easy versatility and reckless variety of effort
there was some sound and patient and constructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
thinking. Lincoln used to describe himself
humorously, slightingly, as a "mast-fed" lawyer,
one who had picked up in the woods the
scattered acorns of legal lore. It was a true
enough description, but after all, there were
very few college-bred lawyers in the Eighth Illinois
Circuit or anywhere else who could hold
their own, even in a purely professional struggle,
with that long-armed logician from the
backwoods.</p>

<p>There was once a "mast-fed" novelist in
this country, who scandalously slighted his
academic opportunities, went to sea, went into
the navy, went to farming, and then went into
novel-writing to amuse himself. He cared nothing
and knew nothing about conscious literary
art; his style is diffuse, his syntax the
despair of school-teachers, and many of his
characters are bores. But once let him strike
the trail of a story, and he follows it like his
own Hawkeye; put him on salt water or in the
wilderness, and he knows rope and paddle, axe
and rifle, sea and forest and sky; and he knows
his road home to the right ending of a story
by an instinct as sure as an Indian's. Professional
novelists like Balzac, professional critics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
like Sainte-Beuve, stand amazed at Fenimore
Cooper's skill and power. The true engineering
and architectural lines are there. They
were not painfully plotted beforehand, like
George Eliot's. Cooper took, like Scott, "the
easiest path across country," just as a bee-hunter
seems to take the easiest path through
the woods. But the bee-hunter, for all his apparent
laziness, never loses sight of the air-drawn
line, marked by the homing bee; and
your <i>Last of the Mohicans</i> will be instinctively,
inevitably right, while your <i>Daniel Deronda</i>
will be industriously wrong.</p>

<p>Cooper literally builded better than he knew.
Obstinately unacademic in his temper and
training, he has won the suffrages of the most
fastidious and academic judges of excellence in
his profession. The secret is, I suppose, that
the lawlessness, the amateurishness, the indifference
to standards were on the surface,&mdash;apparent
to everybody,&mdash;the soundness and
rightness of his practice were unconscious.</p>

<p>Franklin and Lincoln and Cooper, therefore,
may be taken as striking examples of individuals
trained in the old happy-go-lucky
way, and yet with marked capacities for socialization,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
for fellowship. They succeeded, even
by the vulgar tests of success, in spite of their
lack of discipline. But for most men the chief
obstacle to effective labor even as individuals
is the lack of thoroughgoing training.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to add that there are
vast obstacles in the way of individualism as a
working theory of society. Carlyle's theory of
"Hero Worship" has fewer adherents than
for half a century. It is picturesque,&mdash;that
conception of a great, sincere man and of a
world reverencing him and begging to be led
by him. But the difficulty is that contemporary
democracy does not say to the Hero, as
Carlyle thought it must say, "Govern me! I am
mad and miserable, and cannot govern myself!"</p>

<p>Democracy says to the Hero, "Thank you
very much, but this is our affair. Join us, if
you like. We shall be glad of your company.
But we are not looking for governors. We
propose to govern ourselves."</p>

<p>Even from the point of view of literature
and art,&mdash;fields of activity where the individual
performer has often been felt to be quite
independent of his audience,&mdash;it is quite evident
nowadays that the old theory of individualism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
breaks down. Even your lyric poet,
who more than any other artist stands or sings
alone, falls easily into mere lyric eccentricity
if he is not bound to his fellows by wholesome
and normal ties. In fact, this lyric eccentricity,
weakness, wistfulness, is one of the notable defects
of American poetry. We have always been
lacking in the more objective forms of literary
art, like epic and drama. Poe, and the imitators
of Poe, have been regarded too often by
our people as the normal type of poet. One
must not forget the silent solitary ecstasies
that have gone into the making of enduring
lyric verse, but our literature proves abundantly
how soon sweetness may turn to an
Emily Dickinson strain of morbidness; how
fatally the lovely becomes transformed into the
queer. The history of the American short
story furnishes many similar examples. The
artistic intensity of a Hawthorne, his ethical
and moral preoccupations, are all a part of the
creed of individualistic art. But both Hawthorne
and Poe would have written,&mdash;one dare
not say better stories, but at least greater and
broader and more human stories,&mdash;if they
had not been forced to walk so constantly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
solitary pathways. That fellowship in artistic
creation which has characterized some of the
greatest periods of art production was something
wholly absent from the experience of
these gifted and lonely men. Even Emerson
and Thoreau wrote "whim" over their portals
more often than any artist has the privilege to
write it. Emerson never had any thorough
training, either in philosophy, theology, or
history. He admits it upon a dozen smiling
pages. Perhaps it adds to his purely personal
charm, just as Montaigne's confession of his intellectual
and moral weaknesses heightens our
fondness for the Prince of Essayists. But the
deeper fact is that not only Emerson and Thoreau,
Poe and Hawthorne, but practically every
American writer and artist from the beginning
has been forced to do his work without the sustaining
and heartening touch of national fellowship
and pride. Emerson himself felt the
chilling poverty in the intellectual and emotional
life of the country. He betrays it in this
striking passage from his <i>Journal</i>, about the
sculptor Greenough:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"What interest has Greenough to make a
good statue? Who cares whether it is good?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
A few prosperous gentlemen and ladies; but
the Universal Yankee Nation roaring in the
capitol to approve or condemn would make his
eye and hand and heart go to a new tune."</p></blockquote>

<p>Those words were written in 1836, but we
are still waiting for that new national anthem,
sustaining the heart and the voice of the individual
artist. Yet there are signs that it is coming.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the day for the old individualism
has passed. Whether one looks at
art and literature or at the general activities of
American society, it is clear that the isolated individual
is incompetent to carry on his necessary
tasks. This is not saying that we have
outgrown the individual. We shall never outgrow
the individual. We need for every page
of literature and for every adequate performance
of society more highly perfected individuals.
Some one said of Edgar Allan Poe that
he did not know enough to be a great poet.
All around us and every day we find individuals
who do not know enough for their specific
job; men who do not love enough, men in
whom the power of will is too feeble. Such
men, as individuals, must know and love and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
will more adequately; and this not merely to
perfect their functioning as individuals, but to
fulfill their obligations to contemporary society.
A true spiritual democracy will never be
reached until highly trained individuals are
united in the bonds of fraternal feeling. Every
individual defect in training, defect in aspiration,
defect in passion, becomes ultimately a
defect in society.</p>

<p>Let us turn, then, to those conditions of
American society which have prepared the way
for, and foreshadowed, a more perfect fellowship.
We shall instantly perceive the relation
of these general social conditions to the specific
performances of our men of letters. We have
repeatedly noted that our most characteristic
literature is what has been called a citizen literature.
It is the sort of writing which springs
from a sense of the general needs of the community
and which has had for its object the safe-guarding
or the betterment of the community.
Aside from a few masterpieces of lyric poetry,
and aside from the short story as represented
by such isolated artists as Poe and Hawthorne,
our literature as a whole has this civic note. It
may be detected in the first writings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
colonists. Captain John Smith's angry order
at Jamestown, "He that will not work neither
let him eat," is one of the planks in the platform
of democracy. Under the trying and depressing
conditions of that disastrous settlement
at Eden in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> it is the
quick wits and the brave heart of Mark Tapley
which prove him superior to his employer.
The same sermon is preached in Mr. Barrie's
play, <i>The Admirable Crichton</i>: cast away upon
the desert island, the butler proves himself a
better man than his master. This is the motive
of a very modern play, but it may be illustrated
a hundred times in the history of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in America.
The practical experiences of the colonists
confirmed them in their republican theories. It
is true that they held to a doctrine of religious
and political individualism. But the moment
these theories were put to work in the wilderness
a new order of things decreed that this individualism
should be modified in the direction
of fellowship. Calvinism itself, for all of its insistence
upon the value of the individual soul,
taught also the principle of the equality of all
souls before God. It was thus that the <i>Institutes</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
of Calvin became one of the charters of
democracy. The democratic drift in the writings
of Franklin and Jefferson is too well known
to need any further comment. The triumph
of the rebellious colonists of 1776 was a triumph
of democratic principles; and although
a Tory reaction came promptly, although Hamiltonianism
came to stay as a beneficent check
to over-radical, populistic theories, the history
of the last century and a quarter has abundantly
shown the vitality and the endurance of democratic
ideas.</p>

<p>One may fairly say that the decade in which
American democracy revealed its most ugly
and quarrelsome aspect was the decade of the
eighteen-thirties. That was the decade when
Washington Irving and Fenimore Cooper came
home from long sojourns in Europe. They
found themselves confronted at once by sensitive,
suspicious neighbors who hated England
and Europe and had a lurking or open hostility
towards anything that savored of Old World
culture. Yet in that very epoch when English
visitors were passing their most harsh and censorious
verdict upon American culture, Emerson
was writing in his <i>Journal</i> (June 18, 1834)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
a singular prophecy to the effect that the evils
of our democracy, so far as literature was concerned,
were to be cured by the remedy of
more democracy. Is it not striking that he turns
away from the universities and the traditional
culture of New England and looks towards the
Jacksonism of the new West to create a new
and native American literature? Here is the
passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"We all lean on England; scarce a verse,
a page, a newspaper, but is writ in imitation of
English forms; our very manners and conversation
are traditional, and sometimes the life
seems dying out of all literature, and this
enormous paper currency of Words is accepted
instead. I suppose the evil may be cured by
this rank rabble party, the Jacksonism of the
country, heedless of English and of all literature&mdash;a
stone cut out of the ground without
hands;&mdash;they may root out the hollow dilettantism
of our cultivation in the coarsest way,
and the new-born may begin again to frame
their own world with greater advantage."</p></blockquote>

<p>From that raw epoch of the eighteen-thirties
on to the Civil War, one may constantly detect
in American writing the accents of democratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
radicalism. Partly, no doubt, it was a heritage
of the sentiment of the French Revolution.
"My father," said John Greenleaf Whittier,
"really believed in the Preamble of the Bill of
Rights, which re-affirmed the Declaration of
Independence." So did the son! Equally clear
in the writings of those thirty years are echoes
of the English radicalism which had so much
in common with the democratic movement
across the English Channel. The part which
English thinkers and English agitators played
in securing for America the fruits of her own
democratic principles has never been adequately
acknowledged.</p>

<p>That the outcome of the Civil War meant
a triumph of democratic ideas as against aristocratic
privilege, no one can doubt. There were
no stancher adherents of the democratic idea
than our intellectual aristocrats. The best
Union editorials at the time of the Civil War,
says James Ford Rhodes, were written by scholars
like Charles Eliot Norton and James Russell
Lowell. I think it was Lowell who once said,
in combatting the old aristocratic notion of
white man supremacy, that no gentleman is
willing to accept privileges that are inaccessible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
to other men. This is precisely like the famous
sentence of Walt Whitman which first arrested
the attention of "Golden Rule Jones," the
mayor of Toledo, and which made him not
only a Whitmaniac for the rest of his life but
one of the most useful of American citizens.
The line was, "I will accept nothing which all
may not have their counterpart of on the same
terms."</p>

<p>This instinct of fellowship cannot be separated,
of course, from the older instincts of
righteousness and justice. It involves, however,
more than giving the other man his due.
It means feeling towards him as towards another
"fellow." It involves the sentiment of
partnership. Historians of early mining life in
California have noted the new phase of social
feeling in the mining-camps which followed
upon the change from the pan&mdash;held and
shaken by the solitary miner&mdash;to the cradle,
which required the coöperation of at least two
men. It was when the cradle came in that the
miners first began to say "partner." As the
cradle gave way to placer mining, larger and
larger schemes of coöperation came into use.
In fact, Professor Royce has pointed out in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
<i>History of California</i> that the whole lesson of
California history is precisely the lesson most
necessary to be learned by the country as a
whole, namely, that the phase of individual
gain-getting and individualistic power always
leads to anarchy and reaction, and that it
becomes necessary, even in the interests of
effective individualism itself, to recognize the
compelling and ultimate authority of society.</p>

<p>What went on in California between 1849
and 1852 is precisely typical of what is going
on everywhere to-day. American men and
women are learning, as we say, "to get together."
It is the distinctly twentieth-century
programme. We must all learn the art of getting
together, not merely to conserve the interests
of literature and art and society, but
to preserve the individual himself in his just
rights. Any one who misunderstands the depth
and the scope of the present political restlessness
which is manifested in every section of the
country, misunderstands the American instinct
for fellowship. It is a law of that fellowship
that what is right and legitimate for me is right
and legitimate for the other fellow also. The
American mind and the American conscience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
are becoming socialized before our very eyes.
American art and literature must keep pace
with this socialization of the intelligence and
the conscience, or they will be no longer representative
of the true America.</p>

<p>Literary illustrations of this spirit of fraternalism
lie close at hand. They are to be found
here and there even in the rebellious, well-nigh
anarchic, individualism of the Concord men.
They are to be found throughout the prose
and verse of Whittier. No one has preached
a truer or more effective gospel of fellowship
than Longfellow, whose poetry has been one
of the pervasive influences in American democracy,
although Longfellow had but little to
say about politics and never posed in a slouch
hat and with his trousers tucked into his boots.
Fellowship is taught in the <i>Biglow Papers</i> of
Lowell and the stories of Mrs. Stowe. It is
wholly absent from the prose and verse of Poe,
and it imparts but a feeble warmth to the delicately
written pages of Hawthorne. But in the
books written for the great common audience
of American men and women, like the novels
of Winston Churchill; and in the plays which
have scored the greatest popular successes, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
those of Denman Thompson, Bronson Howard,
Gillette, Augustus Thomas, the doctrine of
fellowship is everywhere to be traced. It is in
the poems of James Whitcomb Riley and of
Sam Walter Foss; in the work of hundreds of
lesser known writers of verse and prose who
have echoed Foss's sentiment about living in
a "house by the side of the road" and being
a "friend of man."</p>

<p>To many readers the supreme literary example
of the gospel of American fellowship
is to be found in Walt Whitman. One will
look long before one finds a more consistent
or a nobler doctrine of fellowship than is
chanted in <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. It is based upon
individualism; the strong body and the possessed
soul, sure of itself amid the whirling of
the "quicksand years"; but it sets these strong
persons upon the "open road" in comradeship;
it is the sentiment of comradeship which
creates the indissoluble union of "these States";
and the States, in turn, in spite of every
"alarmist," "partialist," or "infidel," are to
stretch out unsuspicious and friendly hands of
fellowship to the whole world. Anybody has
the right to call <i>Leaves of Grass</i> poor poetry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
if he pleases; but nobody has the right to deny
its magnificent Americanism.</p>

<p>It is not merely in literature that this message
of fellowship is brought to our generation.
Let me quote a few sentences from the recent
address of George Gray Barnard, the sculptor,
in explaining the meaning of his marble groups
now placed at the entrance to the Capitol
of Pennsylvania. "I resolved," says Barnard,
"that I would build such groups as should
stand at the entrance to the People's temple
... the home of those visions of the ever-widening
and broadening brotherhood that gives
to life its dignity and its meaning. Life is told
in terms of labor. It is fitting that labor, its triumphs,
its message, should be told to those
who gaze upon a temple of the people. The
worker is the hope of all the future. The needs
of the worker, his problems, his hopes, his untold
longings, his sacrifices, his triumphs, all
of these are the field of the art of the future.
Slowly we are groping our way towards the new
brotherhood, and when that day dawns, men
will enter a world made a paradise by labor.
Labor makes us kin. It is for this reason that
there has been placed at the entrance of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
great building the message of the Adam and
Eve of the future, the message of labor and of
fraternity."</p>

<p>That there are defects in this gospel and
programme of American fellowship, every one
is aware. If the obstacle to effective individualism
is lack of discipline, the obstacles to effective
fellowship are vagueness, crankiness, inefficiency,
and the relics of primal selfishness.
Nobody in our day has preached the tidings
of universal fellowship more fervidly and powerfully
than Tolstoï. Yet when one asks the
great Russian, "What am I to do as a member
of this fellowship?" Tolstoï gives but a confused
and impractical answer. He applies to
the complex and contradictory facts of our
contemporary civilization the highest test and
standard known to him: namely, the principles
of the New Testament. But if you ask
him precisely how these principles are to be
made the working programme of to-morrow,
the Russian mysticism and fanaticism settle
over him like a fog. We pass Tolstoïans on
the streets of our American cities every day;
they have the eyes of dreamers, of those who
would build, if they could, a new Heaven and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
a new Earth. But they do not know exactly
how to go about it. Our practical Western
minds seize upon some actual plan for constructive
labor. Miss Jane Addams organizes
her settlements in the slums; Booker Washington
gives his race models of industrial education;
President Eliot has a theory of university
reform and then struggles successfully for
forty years to put that theory into practice.
Compared with the concrete performance of
such social workers as these, the gospel according
to Whitman and Tolstoï is bound to seem
vague in its outlines, and ineffective in its concrete
results. That such a gospel attracts cranks
and eccentrics of all sorts is not to be wondered
at. They come and go, but the deeper conceptions
of fraternalism remain.</p>

<p>A further obstacle to the progress of fellowship
lies in selfishness. But let us see how even
the coarser and rawer and cruder traits of the
American character may be related to the
spirit of common endeavor which is slowly
transforming our society, and modifying, before
our eyes, our contemporary art and literature.</p>

<p>"The West," says James Bryce, "is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
most American part of America, that is to say
the part where those features which distinguish
America from Europe come out in the strongest
relief." We have already noted in our study
of American romance how the call of the West
represented for a while the escape from reality.
The individual, following that retreating horizon
which we name the West, found an escape
from convention and from social law. Beyond
the Mississippi or beyond the Rockies meant
to him that "somewheres east of Suez" where
the Ten Commandments are no longer to be
found, where the individual has free rein. But
by and by comes the inevitable reaction, the
return to reality. The pioneer sobers down;
he finds that "the Ten Commandments will not
budge"; he sees the need of law and order; he
organizes a vigilance committee; he impanels
a jury, even though the old Spanish law does
not recognize a jury. The new land settles to
its rest. The output of the gold mines shrinks
into insignificance when compared with the cash
value of crops of hay and potatoes. The old
picturesque individualism yields to a new social
order, to the conception of the rights of
the state. The story of the West is thus an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
epitome of the individual human life as well as
the history of the United States.</p>

<p>We have been living through a period where
the mind of the West has seemed to be the
typical national mind. We have been indifferent
to traditions. We have overlooked the defective
training of the individual, provided he
"made good." We have often, as in the free
silver craze, turned our back upon universal
experience. We have been recklessly deaf to
the teachings of history; we have spoken of the
laws of literature and art as if they were mere
conventions designed to oppress the free activity
of the artist. Typical utterances of our
writers are Jack London's "I want to get away
from the musty grip of the past," and Frank
Norris's "I do not want to write literature, I
want to write life."</p>

<p>The soul of the West, and a good deal of
the soul of America, has been betrayed in words
like those. Not to share this hopefulness of the
West, its stress upon feeling rather than thinking,
its superb confidence, is to be ignorant of
the constructive forces of the nation. The humor
of the West, its democracy, its rough kindness,
its faith in the people, its generous notion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
of "the square deal for everybody," its elevation
of the man above the dollar, are all typical
of the American way of looking at the world.
Typical also, is its social solidarity, its swift
emotionalism of the masses. It is the Western
interest in the ethical aspect of social movements
that is creating some of the moving forces
in American society to-day. Experiment stations
of all kinds flourish on that soil. Chicago
newspapers are more alive to new ideas than
the newspapers of New York or Boston. No
one can understand the present-day America
if he does not understand the men and women
who live between the Allegheny Mountains
and the Rocky Mountains. They have worked
out, more successfully than the composite population
of the East, a general theory of the
relation of the individual to society; in other
words, a combination of individualism with
fellowship.</p>

<p>To draw up an indictment against this typical
section of our country is to draw up an indictment
against our people as a whole. And
yet one who studies the literature and art produced
in the great Mississippi Valley will see,
I believe, that the needs of the West are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
real needs of America. Take that commonness
of mind and tone, which friendly foreign critics,
from De Tocqueville to Bryce, have indicated
as one of the dangers of our democracy. This
commonness of mind and tone is often one of
the penalties of fellowship. It may mean a
levelling down instead of a levelling up.</p>

<p>Take the tyranny of the majority,&mdash;to which
Mr. Bryce has devoted one of his most suggestive
chapters. You begin by recognizing the
rights of the majority. You end by believing
that the majority must be right. You cease to
struggle against it. In other words, you yield
to what Mr. Bryce calls "the fatalism of the
multitude." The individual has a sense of insignificance.
It is vain to oppose the general
current. It is easier to acquiesce and to submit.
The sense of personal responsibility lessens.
What is the use of battling for one's own opinions
when one can already see that the multitude
is on the other side? The greater your
democratic faith in the ultimate rightness of
the multitude, the less perhaps your individual
power of will. The easier is it for you to believe
that everything is coming out right, whether
you put your shoulder to the wheel or not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>The problem of overcoming these evils is
nothing less than the problem of spiritualizing
democracy. There are some of our hero-worshipping
people who think that that vast result
can still be accomplished by harking back to
some such programme as the "great man"
theory of Carlyle. Another theory of spiritualizing
democracy, no less familiar to the student
of nineteen-century literature, is what is
called "the divine average" doctrine of Walt
Whitman. The average man is to be taught
the glory of his walk and trade. Round every
head there is to be an aureole. "A common
wave of thought and joy, lifting mankind
again," is to make us forget the old distinction
between the individual and the social group.
We are all to be the sons of the morning.</p>

<p>We must not pause to analyze or to illustrate
these two theories. Carlyle's theory seems
to me to be outworn, and Whitman's theory
is premature. But it is clear that they both
admit that the mass of men are as yet incompletely
spiritualized, not yet raised to their full
stature. Unquestionably, our American life is,
in European eyes at least, monotonously uniform.
It is touched with self-complacency. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
is too intent upon material progress. It confuses
bigness with greatness. It is unrestful. It is
marked by intellectual impatience. Our authors
are eager to write life rather than literature. But
they are so eager that they overlook the need
of literary discipline. They do not learn to
write literature and therefore most of them are
incapable of interpreting life. They escape, perhaps,
from "the musty grip of the past," but
in so doing they refuse to learn the inexorable
lessons of the past. Hence the fact that our
books lack power, that they are not commensurate
with the living forces of the country.
The unconscious, moral, and spiritual life of
the nation is not back of them, making "eye
and hand and heart go to a new tune."</p>

<p>If we could have that, we should ask no
more, for we believe in the nation. I heard a
doctor say, the other day, that a man's chief lesson
was to pull his brain down into his spinal
cord; that is to say, to make his activities not
so much the result of conscious thought and
volition, as of unconscious, reflex action; to
stop thinking and willing, and simply <i>do</i> what
one has to do. May there not be a hint here
of the ultimate relation of the individual to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
social organism; the relation of our literature
to our national character? There is a period,
no doubt, when the individual must painfully
question himself, test his powers, and acquire
the sense of his own place in the world. But
there also comes a more mature period when he
takes that place unconsciously, does his work
almost without thinking about it, as if it were
not his work at all. The brain has gone down
into the spinal cord; the man is functioning as
apart of the organism of society; he has ceased
to question, to plan, to decide; it is instinct
that does his work for him.</p>

<p>Literature and art, at their noblest, function
in that instinctive way. They become the unconscious
expression of a civilization. A nation
passes out of its adolescent preoccupation
with plans and with materials. It learns to do
its work, precisely as Goethe bade the artist do
his task, without talking about it. We, too,
shall outgrow in time our questioning, our self-analysis,
our futile comparison of ourselves
with other nations, our self-conscious study of
our own national character. We shall not forget
the distinction between "each" and "all,"
but "all" will increasingly be placed at the service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
of "each." With fellowship based upon
individualism, and with individualism ever
leading to fellowship, America will perform
its vital tasks, and its literature will be the
unconscious and beautiful utterance of its
inner life.</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
